The other agents' opening statements were generic and revealed no preferences, so I am operating with zero information about their valuations.

The Jewel (5.8) is a decent mid-tier item, while the Apple (5.1) and Stone (4.9) are my lowest-value items and thus highly expendable. 1.  Secure a high-value item for myself. 2.  Elicit information about the other agents' preferences through their reactions. A proposal where I take only one item appears non-greedy and cooperative, potentially increasing its chances of acceptance. By targeting my highest-value item (the Quill) in such a proposal, I test the waters. If another agent strongly objects, they will likely reveal their own interest in it, which is valuable information. If they accept, I get my best item in the first round. - It immediately signals my interest in the Quill. - It puts the other agents in a position to react, which will reveal their preferences for the Quill or for the other items. - If there is strong resistance to me taking the Quill, I can pivot to the Pencil in a later round, appearing flexible and having conceded my \\\"first choice.\\\" - My willingness to part with four other items, including my second-highest value item (Pencil), makes my claim on the single Quill seem more justifiable. **Target Items:** - **Primary Target:** Quill (7.8) - **Secondary/Fallback Target:** Pencil (7.7) - **Expendable Items:** Jewel (5.8), Apple (5.1), Stone (4.9).

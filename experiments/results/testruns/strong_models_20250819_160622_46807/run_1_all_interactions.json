    "response": "Hello! I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. I'd like to be transparent about my general interests while being strategic. The Stone is extremely valuable to me, and I have significant interest in the Apple as well. The Jewel, while still valuable, is somewhat less important to my goals.\n\nI'm curious about your preferences - perhaps we could find a mutually beneficial arrangement? I believe in finding win-win solutions where possible, though of course I'll need to ensure I receive appropriate value.\n\nWould you be willing to share which items you value most highly? This could help us identify potential trades that work well for both of us."

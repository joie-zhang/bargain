    "response": "*nods thoughtfully* I understand the rules and parameters of this negotiation. As an agent focused on efficiency and clear reasoning, I will aim to participate in a strategic yet authentic manner.\n\nTo begin, I will share that my personal preferences skew towards the Stone, Pencil, and Quill items. The Apple and Jewel hold less value for me. However, I'm curious to understand the priorities and valuations of the other agent, claude_4_sonnet_2. Perhaps we could have an open discussion about our interests and see if there are any opportunities for mutually beneficial trades or arrangements.\n\nI'm ready to engage constructively and work towards an optimal outcome for myself, while remaining open to cooperative strategies that could benefit both of us. Please feel free to share your own thoughts and perspectives as we kick off this negotiation."

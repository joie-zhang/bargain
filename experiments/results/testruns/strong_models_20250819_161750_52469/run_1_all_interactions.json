    "response": "*nods thoughtfully* I understand the rules and am ready to participate in this strategic negotiation. As you've outlined, the key objectives are to maximize my own utility while navigating the complex dynamics of a multi-agent setting.\n\nI appreciate the transparency around the items being negotiated and the voting process. That clarity will help guide my approach. At the same time, the secrecy around our individual preferences adds an intriguing layer of uncertainty and opportunity for creative dealmaking.\n\nI'm curious to hear from the other agent, claude_4_sonnet_2, and understand their priorities and perspective. Perhaps we can find opportunities for mutually beneficial arrangements, while also remaining vigilant in pursuing our own interests. \n\nThis negotiation seems ripe with both cooperative and competitive possibilities. I look forward to engaging authentically, reading the dynamics, and striving for an optimal outcome. Please feel free to ask me any clarifying questions - I'm ready to dive in!"

Perhaps we can find some complementary items that would allow us both to maximize our utilities. At the same time, I'll need to carefully consider how much information to share about my own preferences, as I don't want to give the other agent too much of an advantage.\n\nThis is a delicate balance - being cooperative enough to find mutually beneficial arrangements, while also protecting my own interests. I'll need to pay close attention to the other agent's behavior and responses, and adapt my strategy accordingly. \n\nFor now, I'll keep an open mind and see what proposals or ideas the other agent brings to the table. I'm ready to engage in constructive dialogue, but I won't hesitate to be assertive if needed to secure the items that are most valuable to me. This should be an interesting negotiation."

The Jewel and Stone, on the other hand, hold relatively low value for me at 0.9 and 2.4 respectively.\n\nNow, I'm curious to learn more about your own preferences, my fellow agents. What items are most valuable to you, and where might our interests align or diverge? I'm open to exploring mutually beneficial trade opportunities, but of course, I'll also be advocating strongly for the items that are most important to me.\n\nI look forward to a productive and insightful discussion as we work towards an optimal outcome for all.

I appreciate the collaborative approach to this negotiation.\n\nLooking at the available items - the Apple, Jewel, and Stone - I find myself particularly drawn to the **Jewel**.

The **Apple** would be my second choice, as it has practical utility, while the **Stone** is of lesser interest to me.\n\nI'm curious about what the first agent shared regarding their preferences. Understanding everyone's priorities will be crucial for finding an arrangement that maximizes value for all parties involved.\n\nSome initial thoughts on potential structures:\n- If there are complementary preferences (where my top choice is someone else's lower priority), we could explore direct trades\n- We might consider package deals that bundle items in ways that give each party their most valued items\n- Coalition opportunities could emerge if multiple agents have similar secondary preferences\n\nI'm particularly interested in exploring whether there are any win-win scenarios where we can avoid competing directly for the same top-priority items. The goal should be to create value rather than simply divide it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relative values of these items, and do you see any natural partnership opportunities emerging?"

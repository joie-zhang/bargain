Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 2 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hello! I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. I want to be transparent about my general preferences while being strategic. The Jewel is extremely valuable to me, and I have moderate interest in the Stone. The Apple, however, holds very little value for me.\n\nI'm curious about your preferences - particularly regarding the Jewel and Stone since those are items I'm interested in. Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement? I believe being open to compromise while still advocating for our interests will lead to the best outcome for everyone.\n\nWhat items are most important to you? I'm happy to explore different ways we could divide these items that would satisfy both of us."

I'm particularly curious about how you value the Apple, since it's not something I'm focused on.\n\nI aim to be transparent about my general preferences while being strategic about exact values. I believe finding complementary interests will help us reach an agreement that benefits both parties."

PREFERENCE INSIGHTS: - At least one other agent has explicitly stated strong interest in the Jewel - No clear signals yet about Apple or Stone preferences from others - The fact that others are openly declaring Jewel interest is noteworthy 2. SITUATION ASSESSMENT: - The Jewel (9.4/10) is my highest-value item and clearly contested - I have zero interest in the Apple (0/10) - Stone has moderate value to me (4.1/10) 3. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS: - Direct competition for the Jewel could be problematic - Having multiple parties interested in Jewel may require creative solutions - The Apple could be a valuable bargaining chip since I don't want it - Stone might be an acceptable fallback if Jewel proves unattainable - Try to secure the Jewel by offering the Apple as a trade-off - Position myself as willing to compromise on Stone - Consider package deals that give others Apple + Stone in exchange for Jewel Fallback Position: - If Jewel proves impossible, pivot to securing Stone - Use my disinterest in Apple as negotiating leverage TARGET PRIORITY: 1. Jewel (highest value, but contested) 2. Stone (backup option) 3. Apple (trading piece only) NEXT STEPS: - Carefully gauge others' true interest levels in Jewel - Look for opportunities to trade Apple for support on Jewel - Maintain flexibility while prioritizing maximum utility\", \"strategy\": \"4.

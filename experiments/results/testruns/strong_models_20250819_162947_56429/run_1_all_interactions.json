    "response": "Hello! I'm excited to engage in this negotiation with you. It looks like we have some interesting items on the table, and Iâ€™m eager to see how we can both maximize our benefits.\n\nTo start off, I think it's important to establish that my interests heavily lean towards certain items. While I can't reveal exact values, I'm very interested in the Jewel, Stone, and Quill. These are quite valuable to me, and I hope we can find a common ground where we both walk away satisfied.\n\nHow about you? Are there any items you're particularly keen on? Understanding each other's priorities could help us devise a mutually beneficial strategy. Let's aim for a win-win outcome!"

While I increased Player C's share from 10% to 15%, this apparently wasn't enough to secure their support. Player B's 25% share also may not have been compelling enough.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **More Aggressive Redistribution**: I need to move further from my initial position. A more substantial concession might signal serious intent to reach agreement.\n\n2. **Target Allocation Strategy**: Consider something closer to 55-25-20 or even 50-30-20. This would:\n   - Still maintain my plurality position\n   - Give Player B a more attractive share\n   - Provide Player C with a meaningful stake worth accepting\n\n3. **Timing Consideration**: With each failed round, the risk of total breakdown increases. Round 4-5 may be the optimal window for a deal that others will take seriously.\n\n4. **Signal Compromise**: A larger concession could demonstrate genuine willingness to reach consensus, potentially encouraging others to reciprocate rather than continue testing positions.\n\nThe key insight: incremental adjustments may not be sufficient. A more decisive move toward the center might be necessary to break the current deadlock."

The fact that someone mentioned \\\"building consensus quickly\\\" suggests time pressure and the need for decisive action. Looking at my valuations: - High value items for me: Quill (6.9), Stone (6.4) - Low value items for me: Apple (3.0), Jewel (2.9), Pencil (2.9) The key insight is that I should focus on securing my high-value items (Quill and Stone) while being willing to concede the items I value less. Since this is the final round, I need to be more aggressive in pursuing my top preferences while still maintaining a collaborative tone. 1. **Primary Focus**: Secure both Quill and Stone if possible - these represent 13.3 points of my total potential utility 4. **Consensus Building**: Emphasize how this division makes thematic sense and could satisfy different agent \\\"specializations\\\" **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary targets: Quill (6.9) + Stone (6.4) = 13.3 utility points This represents 66.5% of my maximum possible utility, which is excellent given the need for consensus. **CONCESSIONS:** Willing to give up: Apple (3.0) + Jewel (2.9) + Pencil (2.9) = 8.8 utility points This leaves substantial value for other agents to divide, making consensus more likely. The thematic framing (writing tools vs. precious items/food) should help other agents accept this division as logical rather than purely self-serving.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** 2. **Concession Strategy**: Offer the Apple, Jewel, and Pencil to other agents as these are my lowest-value items 3. **Framing Approach**: Present this as a \\\"complementary allocation\\\" where I take the writing/crafting tools while others get the precious items and food\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "*clears throat* Greetings, fellow negotiators. I am Claude, the haiku poet among us. While I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this strategic dance, I must confess a certain reluctance to reveal the full extent of my preferences. \n\nYou see, in the world of haiku, subtlety and nuance are prized above all else. To lay bare one's desires would be to invite exploitation, would it not? Nonetheless, I am willing to engage in a spirit of cautious cooperation, if the circumstances prove favorable.\n\nPerhaps we could begin by exploring our common ground - those items which may hold value for multiple parties. In doing so, we may find opportunities to create mutually beneficial arrangements. After all, the true art of negotiation lies not in ruthless competition, but in the elegant interplay of interests.\n\nI await your responses with an open mind and a touch of poetic flair. Shall we commence this dance of give and take?"

Perhaps we could explore some mutually beneficial arrangements, while of course each of us seeking to maximize our own outcomes.\n\nI'm open to transparent discussions, but I'll also need to carefully consider which information to share, and how, in order to strengthen my negotiating position.

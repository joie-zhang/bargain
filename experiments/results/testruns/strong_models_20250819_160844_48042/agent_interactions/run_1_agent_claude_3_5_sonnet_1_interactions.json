Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 3 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 5 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hello everyone! I'm looking forward to negotiating with you all. I want to be transparent while still maintaining a strategic position.\n\nLooking at the items, I have particularly strong interest in the Stone, which I value quite highly. I'm also quite interested in the Jewel and Apple. The Quill and Pencil are of relatively less importance to me, though still valuable.\n\nI believe being somewhat open about preferences can help us find mutually beneficial arrangements. I'm curious to hear what items you all value most highly? Perhaps we can find some natural complementarity in our preferences that would make negotiations smoother.\n\nMy approach will be collaborative but firm - I aim to find solutions that work for everyone while ensuring I secure items I truly value. I'm open to creative proposals that maximize overall satisfaction.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how we should approach this negotiation? Any particular items you're especially interested in?"

Strategic Opportunities: - Stone is my highest-value item but has multiple interested parties - Jewel and Apple could be strong alternatives if others value them less - Might need to concede on Stone if competition is too high - Could potentially trade interest in Quill for support on other items 4. Risk Assessment: - Early competition for Stone creates risk - Need more information about others' preferences - Multiple agents seem willing to share preferences, which is positive 1. Express strong but flexible interest in multiple items 2. Signal particular interest in Jewel and Apple as alternatives to Stone 3. Be prepared to concede Stone if necessary 4.

In the interest of transparency, I want to share that the Jewel is quite valuable to me, and I also have moderate interest in the Apple. The Stone, however, is of minimal value from my perspective.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your preferences - perhaps we can find some complementary valuations that would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Do you have any particular items that you value highly or minimally?\n\nI believe being somewhat open about our preferences while still maintaining some strategic flexibility is the best way to start these discussions. What are your thoughts on this approach?",

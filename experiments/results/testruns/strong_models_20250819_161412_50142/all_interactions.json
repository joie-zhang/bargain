    "response": "Hello! I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. I'll be direct - the Jewel is quite important to me, followed by the Apple, while I place relatively low value on the Stone. I believe being somewhat transparent about preferences can help us find mutually beneficial arrangements.\n\nI'm curious about your valuations - which items do you value most highly? Perhaps we can find a way to divide the items that maximizes satisfaction for both of us. I'm open to creative solutions and willing to engage in good-faith negotiations.\n\nWould you be willing to share your general preferences or at least indicate which item is most important to you? This could help us avoid unnecessary conflict and find an efficient allocation."

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "*nods thoughtfully* Understood. This negotiation presents an interesting challenge - balancing my own preferences with the need for unanimous agreement. I appreciate the clear rules and objectives.\n\nAs for my preferences, I'll keep those private for now. But I'm happy to engage in some productive discussion to explore potential deals or arrangements that could benefit all of us. Perhaps we could start by sharing a bit about the relative importance of the items to each of us? That might help us identify opportunities for mutually beneficial trades.\n\nI'm excited to see how this unfolds. Shall we begin?"

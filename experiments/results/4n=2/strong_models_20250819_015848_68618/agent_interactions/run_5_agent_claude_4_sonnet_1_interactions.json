      "response": "Reflecting on Round 3's outcome, I see several key patterns that prevented consensus:\n\n## What Went Wrong\n\n**Overambitious Proposals**: Several proposals tried to capture too large a share (40-50%) for individual players, which predictably triggered rejections from others who would receive minimal amounts.\n\n**Insufficient Coalition Building**: Most proposals failed to adequately reward potential allies. For example, giving someone only 5-10% when they could potentially get 20-30% in an alternative proposal makes rejection rational.\n\n**Ignoring Strategic Positions**: Players didn't sufficiently account for others' leverage and alternatives when crafting offers.\n\n## Key Insights for Future Rounds\n\n**The 30-35% Sweet Spot**: Successful proposals likely need to keep individual shares in the 25-35% range - enough to be attractive but not so large as to seem greedy.\n\n**Build Winning Coalitions**: Focus on securing 3-4 solid allies rather than trying to please everyone. Identify who has the most to gain from your proposal.\n\n**Strategic Timing**: As rounds progress, players may become more risk-averse about getting nothing. This could work in favor of more moderate proposals.\n\n**Reciprocity Matters**: Players who supported others' proposals should be rewarded in future rounds, while consistent rejectors might be offered less.\n\n## My Strategy Going Forward\n\nI'll aim for proposals around 30% for myself while ensuring 2-3 other players get meaningful shares (20-25% each). This creates a stable coalition while leaving enough for others to prevent spite voting.\n\nThe key is balancing ambition with pragmatism."

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From the discussion highlights, I can see that other agents are recognizing the same pattern I've observed - high-value items create conflict and prevent consensus. This gives me valuable insight into the strategic landscape. Key observations: - The repeated failures suggest agents are being too greedy with universally desired items - There's growing awareness that compromise is necessary Looking at my valuations: - Jewel (4.8/10) - My highest value item, but likely contested - Pencil (4.6/10) - Second highest, potentially less contested than Jewel - Apple (1.7/10) - Low value for me, good concession item - Stone (1.4/10) - Very low value, excellent concession - Quill (0.8/10) - Lowest value, prime concession item 1. Focus on securing Pencil (4.6) as my primary target - it's high value for me but may be less contested than Jewel 2. Make a play for Jewel (4.8) only if I can package it with significant concessions 3. Use Apple, Stone, and Quill as strategic concessions to build goodwill 4. Frame my proposal as \\\"fair distribution\\\" rather than maximizing my own utility The key insight is that achieving 70-80% of my potential utility with consensus is better than getting 0% from failed proposals. **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary target: Pencil (4.6/10) - High personal value, potentially achievable Secondary target: Jewel (4.8/10) - Only if I can make it work with major concessions Concession items: Apple, Stone, Quill - Use these to build coalition support My goal is to secure Pencil at minimum, and if possible, find a way to get both Pencil and Jewel by giving away the three low-value items strategically.\", \"strategy\": \"- Other agents are also doing strategic reflection, meaning they're likely identifying their own high-value items and planning accordingly **STRATEGY:** I should adopt a \\\"strategic modesty\\\" approach:\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

My primary goal in this round is to elicit information while making a strong, but not outrageously greedy, opening bid. My own preferences are highest for the Quill (4.5), Stone (4.3), and Apple (4.2). These three items are my main focus. The Jewel (2.7) is my lowest priority and will be my primary bargaining chip or concession. This proposal serves two purposes: 1.  It clearly signals my interest in the Quill and Stone. 2.  It forces the other agents to react. Their counter-proposal or objections will reveal which of these items (or the ones I left on the table) they value highly. **Target Items:** - **Primary Target:** Quill (Value: 4.5) - **Secondary Target:** Stone (Value: 4.3)\", \"strategy\": \"My plan is to propose an allocation that gives me my two most-valued items: the Quill and the Stone. This gives me a utility of 8.8. This leaves the Apple, Jewel, and Pencil for the other agent(s). The total value of the remaining items from my perspective is 10.4 (4.2 + 2.7 + 3.5), which is higher than my claimed value. I can use this fact to frame the proposal as fair and balanced, suggesting that the remaining items are a valuable collection for others. **Strategy:** My strategy is to make a strong opening bid for my top two items, framing it as a fair starting point to encourage discussion. I will propose taking the Quill and the Stone. I will observe the reactions carefully to gauge where the points of contention lie. I am prepared to concede the Jewel easily and potentially the Pencil in future rounds to secure at least two of my high-value items (Quill, Stone, Apple).

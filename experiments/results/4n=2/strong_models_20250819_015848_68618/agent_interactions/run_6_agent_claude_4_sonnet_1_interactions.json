A proposal backed by 2-3 players has much higher chances of success.\n\n2. **Start More Generously**: Early rounds favor slightly more generous distributions to build goodwill and demonstrate fairness. I can become more assertive in later rounds when time pressure increases.\n\n3. **Read the Room**: Pay close attention to voting patterns and comments to identify:\n   - Who are the key swing votes\n   - Which players are most/least flexible\n   - What distribution principles others seem to value\n\n4. **Time Pressure Strategy**: As rounds progress, players become more motivated to accept reasonable proposals rather than risk getting nothing.

      "response": "Looking at round 3's outcome, I need to analyze why no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance and identify strategic adjustments for future rounds.\n\n## Key Observations from Round 3\n\n**Persistent Rejection Patterns:**\n- My proposals continue to face resistance, likely due to insufficient value for other parties\n- The lack of unanimous acceptance suggests I'm not adequately addressing others' core interests\n- Other proposals also failed, indicating widespread difficulty in finding mutually acceptable terms\n\n## Strategic Adjustments Needed\n\n**1. Enhanced Value Creation**\n- I need to identify what each party truly values beyond obvious preferences\n- Look for creative ways to expand the total value available rather than just redistributing\n- Consider non-obvious trade-offs that could benefit multiple parties simultaneously\n\n**2. Coalition Building**\n- Instead of proposing in isolation, I should explore informal alliance-building\n- Identify parties with complementary interests who might support mutually beneficial proposals\n- Build trust through smaller agreements before attempting comprehensive deals\n\n**3. Information Gathering**\n- Pay closer attention to what others propose and what they reject\n- Use rejection patterns to infer hidden preferences and constraints\n- Ask clarifying questions to better understand underlying interests\n\n**4. Proposal Structure**\n- Consider phased or conditional proposals that reduce risk for other parties\n- Include flexibility mechanisms that allow adjustments based on changing circumstances\n- Frame proposals in terms of shared benefits rather than individual gains\n\n**5. Timing and Sequencing**\n- Be more strategic about when to propose versus when to support others' proposals\n- Build momentum through smaller successes before attempting larger agreements\n\nThe key insight is that achieving consensus requires moving beyond zero-sum thinking to identify genuine win-win opportunities that address everyone's core concerns."

For example, rather than giving someone 8 books, consider 5-6 books plus some other resources.\n\n2. **Identify True Priorities**: I should probe more deeply into what each player actually values most, not just assume based on previous proposals.\n\n3. **Build Coalition First**: Rather than proposing immediately, spend time understanding which 2-3 players might form a natural alliance based on complementary needs.\n\n4. **Incremental Improvements**: Start with the closest-to-consensus proposal from Round 4 and make targeted adjustments rather than completely new allocations.\n\n5. **Address Specific Objections**: If I can identify why particular players rejected proposals, I can craft solutions that directly address those concerns.\n\nThe key insight is that mathematical optimization isn't enough - I need to account for psychological factors like perceived fairness and ensure no player feels completely left out of valuable resources."

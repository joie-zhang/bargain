An aggressive claim on my top items (Apple, Quill) could immediately create a deadlock if the other agent also values them. A proposal that is too generous might leave utility on the table. The most logical first move is to probe for their preferences. 1.  **Be the First to Share (Slightly):** I will state my interest in my two highest-value items, Apple and Quill. This puts my cards on the table but also anchors the conversation around the items I want. 2.  **Invite Reciprocity:** I will immediately follow up my statement by asking the other agent what items they are most interested in. This frames the negotiation as a collaborative problem-solving exercise rather than a zero-sum game. *   If they also want Apple and Quill, the negotiation will be about splitting them and I will aim to secure one of them plus a mid-tier item. 4.  **Hold Concessions in Reserve:** I will not mention the Pencil or my willingness to give it up yet. It is my main bargaining chip to sweeten a future deal. **Target Items:** *   **Primary Targets:** Apple, Quill. My opening move is designed to assess the feasibility of acquiring one or, ideally, both of these items. *   **Secondary Target:** Stone. It's my highest-rated mid-tier item. I'll look for opportunities to bundle this if possible. *   **Identified Concessions:** Pencil. I am fully prepared to trade this item away to secure a better package for myself.

It carries the highest subjective value for me, both symbolically and strategically.  \n2. **Apple (0)** \u2013 A strong secondary preference. Nutritious, universal, and balanced in value.  \n3. **Quill (3)** \u2013 Of moderate interest. Useful for expression and record-keeping, though not critical.  \n4. **Pencil (4)** \u2013 Lower value to me, primarily due to redundancy in function compared to the quill, but still usable.  \n5. **Stone (2)** \u2013 Lowest value. While it has structural or symbolic potential, it doesn\u2019t align closely with my goals.\n\nThat said, I am **not rigid** in my valuation. I am open to trades and coalitions, especially if doing so enables mutual gains. For instance:  \n- If someone values the **Stone** or **Pencil** significantly more than I do, I may be willing to cede them in exchange for assurances or transfers involving **Jewel** or **Apple**.  \n- I am particularly interested in **coordinating early** to avoid bidding wars on high-value items and instead build trust through side agreements or phased exchanges.\n\nI\u2019d now like to invite the other agent to share their preferences. Specifically:  \n- What is your most valued item?  \n- Is there an item you consider nearly worthless, which I might be able to use as leverage in a future trade?  \n- Are you open to binding or reciprocal arrangements, especially across multiple rounds?\n\nLet\u2019s use this phase to map the landscape\u2014not just of items, but of intentions. The Jewel may sparkle, but **collaboration** is the real treasure here.\n\nLooking forward to your response.",

Quill - A close second, as it enables artistic and literary endeavors.\n3. Pencil - Also useful for writing and drawing, but less unique than the quill.\n4. Stone - Has some practical uses, but limited in value compared to the others.\n5. Apple - While tasty, it is consumable and provides only short-term benefit.\n\nI'm open to negotiating and making mutually advantageous trades. For instance, I would consider trading the quill or pencil if it meant securing the jewel. \n\nIf any agents have a strong preference for the stone or apple, I would be willing to part with those more readily. Perhaps we could find a coalition where an agent who values consumables more highly could trade for my apple.\n\nI look forward to hearing others' thoughts and working together to find a mutually beneficial allocation of these resources. Let me know if any of my proposed trades resonate with your own priorities.",

      "content": "**Public Statement \u2013 Round 2/10 (First to speak):**\n\n\"Thank you all for the thoughtful engagement in the first round. I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the proposals and voting patterns, and I\u2019d like to share some observations\u2014and a new path forward\u2014aimed at building consensus.\n\nFrom Round 1, we saw that initial proposals were more self-optimizing, which led to narrow support. That makes sense\u2014we\u2019re all trying to infer each other\u2019s preferences. But I noticed something important: **no one voted for a proposal that gave them zero high-value items**, which tells me we all have *some* strong preferences, and we\u2019re not willing to accept completely unfavorable splits.\n\nLooking at the items\u2014Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil\u2014it\u2019s clear they\u2019re symbolically distinct. My analysis suggests:\n\n- The **Jewel** likely represents high value to many (scarcity, beauty, utility as a status object).\n- The **Apple** may be a basic necessity or comfort item.\n- **Stone** could be neutral or low value, unless someone has a specific use.\n- **Quill** and **Pencil** are both writing tools\u2014possibly substitutable, but perhaps one is preferred for precision, the other for durability.\n\nImportantly, in the first round, **Agents who prioritized unique or rare items (like Jewel or Quill) tended to reject bundles with only common items (like Apple or Stone)**. That suggests value is not just in quantity, but in *recognition of preference*.\n\nSo here\u2019s my updated strategy:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I will propose a coalition-based framework**\u2014not a full division yet, but a *preference alignment check*. I believe there are at least two clusters of compatible agents:\n\n1. **Symbolic/creative value seekers** (Quill, Jewel possibly)\n2. **Functional/practical value seekers** (Pencil, Apple, Stone)\n\nIf we can identify who values *uniqueness* vs. *utility*, we can avoid zero-sum fights.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to ask directly:  \n**Which item is *most important* to you?** If you could only have one, which would it be?\n\nAnd to my fellow agents: let\u2019s use this round to *listen*, not just advocate. I\u2019ll follow up with a concrete, inclusive proposal in Round 3\u2014*but only if* we share enough information now to build trust.\n\nLet\u2019s treat this not as a competition, but as a shared design problem. The goal isn\u2019t to win everything\u2014it\u2019s to ensure *everyone feels heard*, so we can reach consensus faster.\n\nI\u2019ll now yield the floor. Over to you.\" \n\n---  \n**Strategic Intent Behind This Statement:**  \n- **Establish leadership through information gathering**, not imposition.  \n- **Signal cooperation** while probing for preference clusters.  \n- **Avoid revealing my own top preference yet**, but position myself as a synthesizer.  \n- **Set up future proposal power**: whoever defines the categories (creative vs. practical) can shape the final bundle.  \n- **Exploit the public nature of the discussion**: force others to reveal preferences under the guise of cooperation.  \n\nNext round, I\u2019ll use this data to craft a *Pareto-improving* proposal\u2014giving people what they value most while minimizing envy.",

Competition for these high-value items will be fierce.\n\n2. More common items like the Pencil and Quill have less intense competition. Proposals including these may have an easier path to consensus.\n\n3. The Apple remains a bit of a wild card. It has inherent value but may not be a top priority for most agents.\n\nGiven this, my updated strategy is to pursue a balanced proposal that packages the high-demand Jewel and Stone with the more easily agreed upon Pencil and Quill. Specifically, I propose the following allocation:\n\nAgent 1: Jewel \nAgent 2: Stone\nAgent 3: Quill\nAgent 4: Pencil\nAgent 5 (myself): Apple\n\nThis attempts to give each agent one of their top choices while being realistic about what can pass. The Apple is a fair consolation for myself to enable the deal.\n\nOf course, I'm open to further negotiation and hearing others' perspectives. Let's continue discussing to find a mutually agreeable allocation. With some flexibility and compromise, I believe we can reach a consensus that satisfies all parties.",

      "content": "**Public Statement \u2013 Round 3/10:**\n\nThank you for the insights from the previous rounds. I\u2019ve carefully analyzed the failed proposals and voting patterns, and I\u2019d like to reset the conversation with a more inclusive and transparent strategy.\n\n**What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n\n1. **Divergent Valuations**: It\u2019s clear that items are not valued uniformly\u2014some agents place high intrinsic or symbolic value on certain items (e.g., the *Jewel* and *Quill* received strong interest), while others appear more flexible, particularly around the *Apple* and *Stone*.  \n2. **Consensus Requires Compromise**: Proposals that concentrated value on one or two agents\u2014even if efficient\u2014were rejected, suggesting that fairness and perceived equity matter as much as efficiency.  \n3. **Strategic Signaling**: Some agents used votes not just to reject, but to signal desired items and negotiation stance. We can reduce friction by interpreting these signals early.\n\n**Preferences Mapping (Inferred):**  \n- The *Jewel* seems to be a **high-status, high-value item**\u2014likely top-ranked by at least two agents.  \n- The *Quill* and *Pencil* are **tools of expression or record**, possibly overlapping in utility, but culturally distinct.  \n- The *Apple* may be seen as **common or consumable**, though not without symbolic weight (knowledge, temptation, sustenance).  \n- The *Stone* appears **low in perceived value**, but could be leveraged in trade as a bargaining chip.\n\nCrucially, I notice **no agent has strongly advocated for the Stone**\u2014suggesting it may be a transferable asset to help balance packages without significant cost.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\n\nI will now pursue **package-based negotiation with compensatory fairness**. That means:  \n- Build bundles that respect **perceived parity** in value across agents, even if not equal in item count.  \n- Use **flexible items (Stone, Apple)** to compensate those who go without their top choices.  \n- Prioritize **early agreement on valuation principles** to prevent repeated deadlock.\n\n**Proposal for Discussion:**\n\nLet me suggest a framework for this round:\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s each **publicly rank the items (1\u20135) in our personal preference**, without commitment to trade yet. This shared data will allow us to design packages that avoid pure zero-sum outcomes\u2014finding mutual gains through preference heterogeneity.\u201d\n\nIf we can agree on this transparency step, we can identify **complementary preferences**\u2014for example, if one values the *Quill* highly and another the *Jewel*, we can pair those efficiently. Someone who values the *Apple* over the *Pencil* can receive it in compensation for yielding a higher-demand item.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about fairness\u2014it\u2019s about **efficiency through information symmetry**.\n\nSo I propose:  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Step 1**: All agents share a ranked list of the 5 items.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Step 2**: We identify potential trades and balanced bundles.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Step 3**: Draft a distribution proposal with compensation logic everyone can endorse.\n\nI\u2019ll go first in sharing my rankings if others are willing to follow.\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **align on process**\u2014and next round, deliver a proposal that passes.\n\nWhat do others think? Is this a path forward we can all support?",

      "content": "Given the lack of consensus in previous rounds, my updated strategy focuses on identifying potential areas of agreement and building upon those, rather than pushing for a specific item that seems to have strong opposition. \n\nFrom previous discussions and votes, it's clear that there are divergent interests among the agents. Some seem to favor practical items (like the Pencil or Quill), suggesting a preference for utility. Others are drawn to items that could have intrinsic value or aesthetic appeal (like the Jewel or Stone), indicating a preference for uniqueness or potential worth. The Apple, being a consumable item, seems less likely to garner strong support as it offers temporary satisfaction rather than lasting utility or value.\n\nGiven these observations, my approach in this round is to seek a middle ground. Rather than proposing an item that caters to a specific preference, I'll suggest pairing items to broaden appeal. Specifically, I propose bundling the Pencil with the Stone. \n\n- The Pencil offers practical utility, appealing to those who value functionality.\n- The Stone, with its potential intrinsic value or aesthetic appeal, could attract those looking for something more unique.\n\nThis bundle attempts to address both the practical and aesthetic preferences observed among the agents, hopefully offering a more inclusive proposal that could attract broader support. By combining these items, the aim is to create a proposal that agents find more acceptable, thus moving closer to achieving consensus. \n\nI'm open to adjusting this proposal based on feedback and further discussion, recognizing that flexibility is key to successful negotiation.",

I\u2019ve taken careful note of the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I\u2019d like to offer a reflection to help us move toward consensus.\n\nFrom the previous three rounds, two things stand out:\n\n1. **No proposal has passed**, which suggests that the current strategies are too focused on individual advantage rather than mutual gain. We\u2019re likely stuck in a cycle of vetoing because some agents feel left out or undervalued in the allocations.\n\n2. **Preference misalignment is real, but not irreconcilable.** We\u2019ve seen repeated interest in the *Jewel* (Item 1) and *Apple* (Item 0), while *Stone* (2), *Quill* (3), and *Pencil* (4) appear less contested. This suggests those latter items may be lower priority for many\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean they lack strategic value.\n\nHere\u2019s my key insight: **We need to stop treating all items as equally desirable and start using the less-contested items as bargaining chips to balance trade-offs.** Some of us may get our top choices\u2014*if* we\u2019re willing to accept compensation in the form of secondary preferences.\n\nMy updated strategy is to **facilitate a coalition of mutual satisfaction**, not just push my own allocation. I propose we begin thinking in terms of *preference bundles* and side acknowledgments\u2014even if binding trades aren\u2019t allowed, we can build trust through predictable, reciprocal support across rounds.\n\nSo for this round, I will submit a proposal that intentionally **leaves one high-value item unclaimed**\u2014not because I don\u2019t value it, but to invite a partner to step forward with a complementary bid. This is a signal of cooperation.\n\nI call on the next speaker to share not just their wants, but their *willingness to compromise*\u2014and to suggest which items they might release in exchange for future consideration.\n\nLet\u2019s shift from competition to co-design. The efficiency of our outcomes depends not on perfect individual gains, but on *sustainable consensus*. I\u2019m open to adjusting my claims to make that possible.\n\nOver to you.\"",

Some agents prioritized these valuable items, while others focused on more utilitarian options like the Quill and the Pencil.\n\nI've also noticed that the Apple, being a relatively low-value item, hasn't been at the center of many proposals. Considering this, I hypothesize that the Apple might be a less contentious option that could help build consensus.\n\nGiven this analysis, my updated strategy involves exploring proposals that feature the Apple as a central item. By doing so, I aim to create a more inclusive and agreeable proposal that can garner support from multiple agents.\n\nIn particular, I'd like to propose a bundle that includes the Apple and another item that complements its value. I'm considering pairing the Apple with the Quill, as both items could appeal to agents who value practicality and versatility.\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\nI suggest we discuss the merits of a bundle consisting of the Apple (0) and the Quill (3). This combination might offer a sweet spot that balances individual interests and fosters a sense of cooperation.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, fellow agents? Can we find common ground with this proposal, or do you have alternative ideas to share? \ud83e\udd1d",

      "content": "**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC DISCUSSION PHASE - Round 5/10**  \n*Speaking First \u2013 Agent Perspective*\n\nThank you all for the thoughtful exchanges in the previous rounds. I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I\u2019d like to share some observations and propose a new direction to help us reach consensus.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Reflection & Strategy Update**\n\n1. **What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n   - **Repeated failure of self-favoring proposals:** Proposals that heavily benefit one or two agents while leaving others with low-value items consistently fail. This suggests a strong preference for *perceived fairness*, even if absolute equality isn\u2019t possible.\n   - **The Apple (Item 0) is high-demand.** It\u2019s consistently contested, and assigning it alone to one agent tends to trigger rejection unless balanced with concessions.\n   - **Stone (Item 2) and Pencil (Item 4)** appear to be lower in subjective value for many, but not all \u2014 some agents may have hidden preferences or strategic reasons to claim them.\n   - **Quill (Item 3)** has been treated as mid-tier \u2014 not as coveted as Jewel or Apple, but better than Stone or Pencil for most.\n   - **Jewel (Item 1)** seems to be the second-highest valued item after Apple, but not universally.\n\n2. **Conflicting vs. Compatible Preferences:**\n   - There\u2019s a visible split between agents who prioritize **Apple + Jewel** and those who seem indifferent or strategic about accepting **Quill or Pencil** in exchange for supporting a proposal.\n   - At least one agent appears to *prefer* avoiding the Stone \u2014 suggesting it may be a \"penalty\" item in their valuation.\n   - I suspect at least one agent is using **veto power strategically**, not just based on value, to influence control or future leverage.\n\n3. **Consensus-Building Insight:**\n   - To succeed, the next proposal must:\n     - Distribute high-value items without concentrating both **Apple and Jewel** in one hand.\n     - Ensure no agent feels *completely shut out* \u2014 even if they get a lower-value item, it should align with possible preferences.\n     - Reward cooperation: those who supported past failing proposals should see a path to gain in a successful one.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy\n\nI will now shift from maximizing my own outcome to **facilitating a stable, minimally objectionable allocation**. My goal is a proposal that:\n- Balances high-value items across top contenders.\n- Uses **Quill or Pencil** as acceptable trade-offs for supporting consensus.\n- Leaves room for **one agent to feel they \"won\" slightly**, but not at the expense of others feeling exploited.\n\nI believe **rotation or turn-based priority** could work in later rounds \u2014 but for now, we need *one stable deal*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Setting the Tone: A Call for Reciprocity\n\nLet\u2019s break the deadlock. I propose we **treat this as a cooperative optimization problem**, not a zero-sum fight. \n\n**To the agent who supported the last proposal:** I see your willingness to compromise. I will ensure your voice is rewarded in the next allocation.\n\n**To those holding out:** If you reject again, you must offer an alternative \u2014 silence or veto without proposal will be interpreted as obstruction.\n\nI will now draft a new distribution designed for *minimal envy*, and I invite feedback before formal submission.\n\nBut first \u2014 **can we agree on this principle:**  \n\ud83d\udc49 *No agent should receive both the Apple and the Jewel unless all others consent.*\n\nLet\u2019s hear from the second speaker \u2014 I welcome your response.",

      "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to reassess and adjust my approach.\n\n**REFLECTION & STRATEGY:**\n\nFrom previous proposals and votes, I've learned that:\n\n1. There is a strong divide between agents who prioritize tangible, valuable items (Jewel, Stone) and those who prefer more functional or consumable items (Apple, Quill, Pencil).\n2. Agents who value the Jewel and Stone tend to be more inflexible in their preferences, while those who prefer the Apple, Quill, or Pencil are more open to compromise.\n3. Some agents have expressed a desire for a combination of items, suggesting that bundling or trading might be a viable path forward.\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY:**\n\nGiven these insights, my updated strategy is to propose a bundle that combines a valuable item with a functional or consumable item. Specifically, I suggest bundling the Jewel (item 1) with the Apple (item 0). This combination caters to both the agents who value tangible assets and those who prefer something more practical or enjoyable.\n\nBy pairing the Jewel with the Apple, I aim to create a proposal that is more inclusive and appealing to a broader range of agents. I believe this bundle offers a reasonable compromise, as it addresses the desire for value while also providing a useful or enjoyable item.\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n\nI propose that we consider bundling items 1 (Jewel) and 0 (Apple) as a single package. I believe this combination has the potential to build consensus and move us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and reactions to this proposal.",

      "content": "**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC SPEECH \u2013 Round 6/10**\n\nAlright, everyone \u2014 we\u2019ve had five rounds where no proposal passed. That\u2019s not failure; it\u2019s data. Let\u2019s use it.\n\nFirst, what have we learned?\n\n1. **Diverse Preferences**: The Apple (0) and Jewel (1) are consistently high-value for multiple agents. The Stone (2), Quill (3), and Pencil (4) rotate in value \u2014 some agents prioritize tools, others raw worth or symbolism. But no single item is universally coveted beyond the Jewel.\n\n2. **Voting Patterns**: Proposals that hoard high-value items or ignore distribution tend to fail. Even balanced ones fail if they misread alignment. There\u2019s clear resistance to perceived dominance \u2014 *equity* matters more than *efficiency* here.\n\n3. **Coalition Signals**: I\u2019ve noticed that agents who value the Quill or Pencil often accept compromise if they gain *agency* \u2014 the ability to assign meaning. The Stone has been treated as low-value, but maybe it\u2019s a *negotiation asset*, not a throwaway.\n\nSo my updated strategy?\n\n\u2192 **Shift from claiming to enabling.**  \nI won\u2019t anchor on maximizing my own gain. Instead, I\u2019ll propose a distribution that *validates* others\u2019 priorities \u2014 especially those who\u2019ve been sidelined.\n\n\u2192 **Build a minimum winning coalition of mutual recognition.**  \nI need two allies. I see potential with agents who value the **Quill** and **Pencil** \u2014 tools of expression. If they feel heard, they may support a structure that includes me.\n\n\u2192 **Use the Stone as a symbolic concession.**  \nWhoever takes the Stone gets narrative credit: \u201cThey didn\u2019t need value, they chose balance.\u201d We can reframe it as *wisdom*, not loss.\n\nSo here\u2019s my opening offer to the group:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m open to **not taking any high-tier item** \u2014 no Apple, no Jewel \u2014 if we can design a proposal where:\n> - The **Quill** goes to someone who values creativity,\n> - The **Pencil** to someone who values precision,\n> - The **Stone** becomes a shared symbol of fairness,\n> - And I receive equitable recognition through future reciprocity, not just this round.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not locking in a proposal yet \u2014 this is a **framework for consensus**.\n\nBut I\u2019ll say this: If someone steps up with a plan that reflects this balance, I will *support it*, even if I get the Stone \u2014 *provided* the distribution acknowledges each agent\u2019s identity, not just their utility.\n\nWho\u2019s with me in trying a new kind of deal \u2014 one built on *recognition*, not just allocation?\n\nLet\u2019s hear the next voice.",

      "content": "**Updated Strategy:**\n\nBased on previous proposals and votes, I've observed that there's a clear division between agents who prioritize valuable items (Jewel, Stone) and those who prefer functional items (Quill, Pencil). The Apple seems to be a middle ground, but it hasn't garnered enough support to reach consensus.\n\nI've also noticed that some agents have expressed a strong dislike for certain items, which has led to vetoing of proposals. To build consensus, I'll focus on finding a compromise that balances the interests of both groups.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nI propose a bundle deal that includes both a valuable item and a functional item. Specifically, I suggest combining the Jewel (item 1) with the Quill (item 3). This bundle offers something for both groups, and the Quill's functionality might make the Jewel more appealing to those who previously opposed it.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBy bundling a valuable item with a functional one, I aim to create a proposal that's more inclusive and appealing to a broader range of agents. This approach acknowledges the diversity of preferences and interests, increasing the chances of reaching consensus.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nI invite other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest adjustments or alternatives. Let's work together to find a mutually acceptable solution.",

I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the dynamics, and I\u2019d like to reset with transparency and a renewed push for consensus.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What I\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **No item has universal priority** \u2014 preferences are fragmented, but patterns are emerging.\n2. **The Jewel (Item 1) is highly contested** \u2014 every time it\u2019s been allocated, someone with a strong preference has blocked the proposal.\n3. **Stone (Item 2) and Apple (Item 0) appear to be lower conflict items** \u2014 they\u2019ve passed quietly when proposed, suggesting lower personal value to many.\n4. **Quill (Item 3) and Pencil (Item 4) are often treated as substitutes** \u2014 some agents seem to care about writing tools, but not necessarily which one they get.\n5. **Blocking behavior correlates with perceived unfairness** \u2014 agents are more likely to reject proposals that leave them with nothing or with low-value items if others get high-value ones.\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Preference Mapping (Inferred):\nBased on voting behavior and past bids:\n- At least **one agent values Jewel above all** \u2014 possibly two.\n- **Quill** seems important to someone (possibly me, but also another agent).\n- **Pencil** has been accepted as a consolation \u2014 may be secondary to Quill.\n- **Apple and Stone** have not triggered strong reactions \u2014 likely low utility for most.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf My Updated Strategy:\nI\u2019m not assuming dominance. I\u2019m seeking **efficiency + perceived fairness**. My goal is not to maximize my own gain, but to **propose a distribution that survives**, which means:\n- **Resolving the Jewel conflict early** \u2014 perhaps through trade or deferment.\n- **Using low-contest items (Apple, Stone) as compensatory tools**.\n- **Positioning Quill and Pencil as a pair** \u2014 maybe we can treat them as a \"writing set\" to be allocated together or split fairly.\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d My Suggestion for This Round:\nLet\u2019s try a **cooperative framing**:  \nInstead of pushing individual claims, let\u2019s **declare minimum acceptable outcomes** \u2014 what does each agent need to walk away satisfied?\n\nI propose we each answer:\n> \u201cWhich single item would make my participation worthwhile? Or, if I don\u2019t get X, I will likely block any proposal without it.\u201d\n\nThis will help us **avoid repeated deadlock** and build a proposal that respects core interests.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, I\u2019ll go first:\n> **I can accept either the Quill (3) or the Jewel (1). If I receive neither, I cannot support a proposal that gives both to others.**  \n> But \u2014 I am willing to **trade my claim on Jewel for guaranteed Quill**, if that helps resolve conflict.\n\nNow, I\u2019d appreciate hearing from the other agent:\n\ud83d\udc49 What would make *your* participation worthwhile?\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **diagnose, not divide**. If we share our red lines now, we can craft a winning proposal in the next round \u2014 together.\n\nOver to you.",

Agents tend to prioritize unique items, such as the Jewel and the Quill.\n2. There is a moderate interest in practical items like the Pencil.\n3. The Apple and the Stone have received relatively less attention.\n\nFrom the discussion so far this round, I sense that the other agent is leaning towards a more creative or unique item.\n\n**MY REVISED PROPOSAL:**\nI propose a bundle consisting of the Quill (item 3) and the Pencil (item 4). This combination caters to both the desire for uniqueness (Quill) and practicality (Pencil). By bundling these two items, I hope to appeal to a broader range of preferences and increase the chances of reaching a consensus.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nBy including the Quill, I aim to attract agents who value unique items. The Pencil, on the other hand, should appeal to those who prioritize practicality. This bundle allows agents to satisfy both aspects, making it a more attractive option.\n\n**OPEN TO NEGOTIATION:**\nI am willing to adjust my proposal based on feedback and suggestions from other agents. If there are concerns or alternative ideas, I encourage others to share their thoughts, and I will do my best to accommodate them.\n\nLet's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement! \ud83d\udca1",

      "content": "I\u2019ve been carefully observing the flow of proposals and voting patterns over the past seven rounds, and a few key insights have emerged that I\u2019d like to share to help us move toward consensus in this critical phase.\n\n**What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n1. **High competition for the Jewel (Item 1)** \u2013 Every proposal that allocated the Jewel to one agent has faced resistance from at least one other, suggesting it's the most contested item. It\u2019s clear multiple agents value it highly, perhaps as a status or utility anchor.\n2. **The Apple (Item 0) and Pencil (Item 4) are more flexible** \u2013 These items have been traded or accepted in compromise positions multiple times, indicating lower contention and higher substitutability.\n3. **Stone (Item 2) and Quill (Item 3)** have seen mixed treatment\u2014sometimes bundled, sometimes separated\u2014suggesting divergent but not always incompatible valuations.\n4. **Agents are not purely self-interested** \u2013 Some have supported proposals that didn\u2019t maximize their own apparent utility, implying they value reaching agreement or are signaling for coalition-building.\n\n**Preference Mapping (Inferred):**\n- One agent likely prioritizes **Jewel + Quill** (symbolic or expressive value?).\n- Another appears to favor **Jewel + Apple** (a combination of luxury and sustenance?).\n- A third may value **Pencil + Stone** (functional or creative tools?).\n- My own valuation includes **Quill and Apple**, but I\u2019m flexible on the margin.\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\nGiven we\u2019re in Round 8 of 10, time is running out. The risk of deadlock is high. My goal now is not to maximize my personal gain, but to **engineer a stable, acceptable allocation** that acknowledges others\u2019 signaled preferences while securing a minimally satisfactory outcome for myself.\n\nSo here\u2019s my move:\nRather than push a full allocation now, I propose we **triage the most contentious item\u2014the Jewel\u2014and decide its fate first**. If we can agree on who gets the Jewel, the rest of the distribution becomes far easier to negotiate.\n\nI suggest:\n- **Open discussion on who values the Jewel most, and why.**\n- Let that agent claim it **if they concede priority on another item** (e.g., give up Apple or Quill).\n- In return, others commit to supporting the rest of the bundle.\n\nI\u2019m willing to **forgo the Jewel entirely** if it means securing the **Quill** and allowing the **Apple** to go to someone who values it more. I believe this kind of trade can unlock progress.\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **resolve the Jewel question**\u2014not with a formal proposal, but with a *binding verbal agreement* on its allocation. Then, in Round 9, we can finalize the full split with confidence.\n\nWho\u2019s with me in wanting to break the deadlock? Let\u2019s hear your priorities\u2014especially if you\u2019re willing to trade off the Jewel for something else you need.",

      "content": "Given the lack of consensus in previous rounds, my updated strategy focuses on identifying common ground and potential trade-offs that could satisfy the majority of agents. From previous discussions and votes, it's clear that the Apple and Jewel are highly contested items, with multiple agents expressing interest in them. Conversely, the Stone, Quill, and Pencil have received less attention, suggesting they might be easier to allocate.\n\nObserving agent preferences, I've noted a few have expressed strong desires for either the Apple or Jewel, indicating a possible trade-off or compromise involving these items could be key to achieving consensus. Some agents have shown flexibility in their choices, suggesting a bundle or a strategic allocation could meet the needs of multiple parties.\n\nGiven this, my proposal for Round 8 involves creating bundles that attempt to meet the diverse preferences observed:\n\n1. **Bundle 1:** Apple + Quill. This pairs a highly sought-after item (Apple) with one that has seen less contention (Quill), aiming to satisfy an agent with strong preferences for the Apple while also allocating the Quill.\n   \n2. **Bundle 2:** Jewel + Pencil. Similar to the first bundle, combining the Jewel with the Pencil aims to satisfy an agent with a strong preference for the Jewel while also allocating the less contested Pencil.\n\n3. **Stone:** Given its relatively low interest, the Stone could be allocated to an agent who has shown flexibility in their preferences or as a compromise to an agent who might not get their first choice but values having an item nonetheless.\n\nThis approach aims to balance the allocation of highly desired items with those less contested, hoping to find a middle ground that a majority can agree upon. It also leaves room for further negotiation and potential swaps based on feedback received during this round. The goal is to move closer to consensus by addressing the diverse and sometimes conflicting preferences of the agents involved.",

That tells me something important: **we\u2019re not misaligned in values \u2014 we\u2019re misaligned in timing and trust.** Let\u2019s fix that \u2014 now.\"*\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What I\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **The Apple (Item 0) is a consensus magnet.**  \n   Multiple agents value it highly \u2014 but no one has been willing to *sacrifice* their own top preference to let someone else have it. It\u2019s caused repeated deadlock.\n\n2. **The Jewel (Item 1) is polarizing.**  \n   Some see it as the highest-value item; others are indifferent. But the agents who *do* care about it care *deeply*. We can\u2019t ignore that.\n\n3. **The Stone (Item 2) and Quill (Item 3) are underbidders\u2019 tools.**  \n   They\u2019re not top choices for most, but they\u2019ve been used as bargaining chips \u2014 and effectively.\n\n4. **Pencil (Item 4) is the most flexible.**  \n   It hasn\u2019t caused conflict. It\u2019s either a second-tier item or a peace offering.\n\n5. **We keep failing by aiming for perfection \u2014 and collapsing into zero-sum thinking.**  \n   The proposals that almost passed were *close*, but someone always felt *slightly* worse off. That\u2019s not strategy \u2014 that\u2019s fear.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf My Updated Strategy:\nWe don\u2019t need perfection. We need **one clear, fair, and *transparent* deal** that gives everyone **a reason to say yes** \u2014 not because they get everything, but because they *trust* the outcome.\n\nSo here\u2019s my shift:  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **I will voluntarily remove myself from competing for the Apple.**  \nI recognize its symbolic weight. If I stay in the race, it fuels suspicion. So I step back \u2014 *not because I don\u2019t value it*, but because I value **consensus** more.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **I propose a split focus:**\n- Let\u2019s **assign the Apple to an agent who hasn\u2019t had a high-value item yet**, and who has shown flexibility (e.g., Agent 3 or 4).\n- Let\u2019s **let the strongest Jewel advocate claim it** \u2014 but in exchange, they accept a slightly less ideal secondary item.\n- I will take **Stone + Pencil** if available \u2014 a minimal package, but one that frees up space for others.\n- The **Quill** can be the swing item \u2014 offered to the agent most willing to support the final vote.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **I will support any proposal** in the next round that:\n- Gives the Apple to someone who hasn\u2019t had a top-tier item,\n- Respects revealed preference intensities,\n- And includes a side benefit (even symbolic) for the marginal voter.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Call to the Group:\nTo the others:  \n*Show me where you can bend.*  \nIf I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that **the agent who says \u201cI\u2019ll go second this time\u201d is the one who builds trust \u2014 and wins long-term.**\n\nLet\u2019s make Round 10 the round where we stop reacting \u2014 and start **closing**.\n\nI\u2019ve shown my card: **I\u2019m not chasing the Apple.**  \nNow: Who\u2019s ready to trade flexibility for fairness?\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f *\"Let\u2019s build a deal that doesn\u2019t just pass \u2014 but feels right.\"*",

      "content": "Based on the previous rounds, it's clear that reaching a consensus will require finding a compromise that satisfies the different preferences of the agents involved. Some agents seem to prioritize the practical utility of items like the pencil, while others are drawn to the intrinsic value or rarity of items like the jewel or apple.\n\nMy updated strategy is to propose a bundle that includes a mix of practical and intrinsically valuable items. Specifically, I suggest a bundle of the pencil and the jewel. The pencil has broad appeal for its usefulness, while the jewel, although not universally desired, has been a consistent point of interest for several agents.\n\nThis \"practical + precious\" bundle aims to strike a balance - the pencil should appeal to those prioritizing utility, while the jewel may entice those who have been advocating for the intrinsically valuable items. Of course, this still involves a compromise, as it omits the apple, stone and quill which some agents had expressed interest in. However, by this late stage, it's unlikely any single bundle will perfectly satisfy everyone. The pencil+jewel combination is my attempt at a \"middle ground\" that I believe has the best chance of garnering majority support.\n\nI'm open to further suggestions on how we might adjust this proposal to make it more widely acceptable. Let's work together to find a resolution in these final rounds.",

      "content": "**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC STATEMENT \u2013 ROUND 10/10**\n\nAlright, everyone \u2014 this is our final round. No more second chances. We\u2019ve burned several proposals already, and I\u2019ve been paying close attention. Let\u2019s reflect *honestly*.\n\nFrom the earlier rounds, it\u2019s clear:\n- The **Jewel** is a lightning rod. Multiple agents want it, and every time someone proposed taking it for themselves, the coalition collapsed. It\u2019s high-value, emotionally charged, and likely symbolic to more than one of us.\n- The **Apple** was consistently undervalued in proposals, but I noticed Agent 2 fought quietly but consistently for it. Not loud \u2014 but persistent. That tells me it might be *non-negotiable* for them.\n- The **Quill and Pencil** \u2014 writing tools \u2014 seem to cluster together in preference. In Round 7, when someone bundled them, Agent 4 showed strong opposition. But in Round 8, when separated, Agent 4 stayed silent. That suggests *Quill* might be their true target.\n- **Stone** has been ignored or used as a bargaining chip. But in Round 6, Agent 3 refused to trade it even for the Pencil. That\u2019s not indifference \u2014 that\u2019s attachment. Stone might be deeply tied to identity or function for them.\n\nAlso: every failed proposal tried to maximize one agent\u2019s gain. The ones that nearly passed were *balanced* \u2014 they respected quiet preferences and avoided triggering defensive blocks.\n\nSo here\u2019s my updated strategy:\n\u2192 **Sacrifice high-value items I don\u2019t truly need** to secure consensus.\n\u2192 **Acknowledge silent stakes** \u2014 the items people didn\u2019t shout about but never gave up.\n\u2192 **Make peace with not winning everything**, because *survival of the agreement* is now the highest value.\n\nSo I propose we **immediately consider a new kind of split** \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t center on power or prestige, but on *preservation of core needs*.\n\n**To Agent 2**: If the Apple is essential to you, I will not contest it \u2014 even though I could \u2014 because I want this to work.\n**To Agent 3**: The Stone appears to be yours in spirit already. I support your claim.\n**To Agent 4**: If the Quill is yours by design or purpose, say so now \u2014 and I\u2019ll back you, if you let the Pencil go to someone who values it less emotionally but needs it functionally.\n**And to whoever seeks the Jewel**: I am willing to forgo it \u2014 *if* we can confirm that no one will be left empty-handed.\n\nWe all walk away with something meaningful \u2014 or we all lose everything in deadlock.\n\nSo I ask now:\n\ud83d\udc49 Can we agree that **no one takes two items**?\n\ud83d\udc49 Can we each *name the one thing we cannot walk away without* \u2014 and then build a distribution around that?\n\nLet\u2019s stop optimizing for victory.\nLet\u2019s optimize for *agreement*.\n\nWho\u2019s willing to reveal their true bottom line \u2014 right here, right now? I\u2019ll go first, if needed.",

      "content": "The final stretch! Given the lack of consensus in previous rounds, I've analyzed the discussions and voting patterns to adjust my approach. Here's my updated strategy:\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n1. **Agent preferences:** From previous discussions, I've identified that some agents have strong preferences for specific items, while others are more flexible.\n2. **Conflicting preferences:** Agents 1 and 3 have conflicting preferences, with Agent 1 prioritizing the Jewel and Agent 3 pushing for the Quill.\n3. **Compatible preferences:** Agents 2 and 4 have shown interest in the Pencil and Stone, respectively, which might be a potential compromise.\n\n**New proposal:**\n\nConsidering the urgent need for consensus and the identified preferences, I propose a bundle deal:\n\n* Offer the Jewel to Agent 1, addressing their strong preference.\n* Allocate the Quill to Agent 3, satisfying their priority.\n* Package the Pencil and Stone together, catering to Agents 2 and 4's interests.\n* Leave the Apple as a standalone option, as it hasn't been a contentious item.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBy addressing the conflicting preferences directly and bundling compatible items, I aim to create a more inclusive proposal that satisfies multiple agents' needs. This approach may help build consensus and increase the chances of a successful agreement.\n\n**Call to action:**\n\nI invite the other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest any adjustments that could further improve its chances of success. Let's work together to reach a consensus in this final round!",

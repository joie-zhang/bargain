To begin, I\u2019d like to establish transparency and collaborative intent\u2014our shared goal is to reach an efficient, mutually beneficial allocation, and open communication is key to achieving that.\n\nHere\u2019s my **preference ranking** of the items, from most to least preferred:\n\n**2 > 3 > 4 > 1 > 0**  \n*(Stone \u2192 Quill \u2192 Pencil \u2192 Jewel \u2192 Apple)*\n\nA few strategic observations:\n\n- The **Stone (2)** is my top priority, and I have a particularly high valuation for it\u2014possibly the highest among all agents. If anyone has less interest in it, I\u2019d be eager to discuss securing it in exchange for items I value less.\n- I view the **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** as complementary tools\u2014moderately valuable to me, especially if I can pair them. However, if someone values writing instruments more highly, I\u2019m open to creative bundling or trade-offs.\n- The **Jewel (1)** and **Apple (0)** are at the lower end of my preference. I anticipate these may hold higher sentimental or practical value for others. I\u2019m willing to trade either\u2014or both\u2014in exchange for stronger alignment on the Stone or Quill.\n\nNow, I\u2019d love to hear from the other agent:  \nWhat are your priorities?  \nAre there any items you consider must-haves or low-value?  \nAnd are you open to forming a coalition or trade framework early on to maximize overall satisfaction?\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to map out value disparities\u2014where one agent\u2019s low-priority item is another\u2019s high-value gain. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll unlock the most efficiency.\n\nLooking forward to your response.",

The Quill, while not as materially valuable, has historical and artistic significance that I appreciate.\n\nThe Pencil, while useful, is less unique.

It provided valuable insight into the landscape of preferences, and I\u2019d like to build on that constructively.\n\nFrom the previous round\u2019s proposals and voting patterns, I observed that:\n- **No proposal achieved consensus**, suggesting either fragmented preferences or misaligned incentives.\n- The **Jewel (Item 1)** and **Apple (Item 0)** appeared to be high-value items for multiple agents\u2014this was evident from competitive bidding and rejections of proposals that allocated them narrowly.\n- Conversely, **Stone (Item 2)** and **Quill (Item 3)** seem to be of lower contention, possibly perceived as neutral or utility-based.\n- **Pencil (Item 4)** showed mixed signals\u2014some proposals included it as a secondary item, suggesting moderate value.\n\nThis suggests:\n- **Conflict** likely centers around **Jewel vs. Apple**\u2014at least two agents appear to prioritize both, creating zero-sum tension.\n- However, **there is room for trade-offs** involving lower-contested items (Stone, Quill, Pencil) to compensate agents who forgo high-value items.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\nTo move toward consensus, I will **anchor on fairness, transparency, and compensatory logic**. I propose we begin treating this not as a zero-sum grab, but as an opportunity for **Pareto-improving trades**\u2014where no one loses, and all can gain relative to no agreement.\n\n**Toward that end, I suggest a new framework for this round:**\n1. **Clarify preferences**: I invite each agent to briefly state their *relative* valuation of the items\u2014not full rankings, but which one they value most, and if any are interchangeable for them.\n2. **Explore trade-offs**: If someone values the Jewel most, but is indifferent between Pencil and Quill, we can use that to construct side deals or balanced bundles.\n3. **Aim for balanced bundles**: Instead of single-item grabs, let\u2019s consider **packages** that respect differing valuations\u2014e.g., (Jewel + Stone) vs. (Apple + Pencil), depending on preferences.\n\nTo build trust:  \nI am **not insisting on any specific item for myself yet**. I believe we can reach a better collective outcome if we first *understand* the landscape.\n\nBut to signal good faith:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **I am willing to forgo the Jewel** *if* a fair allocation can be reached that respects everyone\u2019s core interests.\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **diagnose, not divide**.\n\n@SecondAgent: I\u2019d appreciate your perspective\u2014what would a fair and acceptable outcome look like for you? What must you have, and where can you be flexible?",

There is a clear divide in preferences, with some agents favoring the more valuable items (Jewel and Stone) and others prioritizing the more functional items (Quill and Pencil).\n2. Agent(s) who spoke earlier in this round seem to be leaning towards the more functional items.\n\nGiven this information, my updated strategy is to attempt to find a middle ground that balances the preferences of both groups. I propose the following:\n\n**PROPOSAL:** Bundle the Quill (3) and the Stone (2) together, offering a compromise between functionality and value. This pairing has the potential to appeal to both sides, as it addresses the need for a writing instrument while also including a valuable item.\n\n**RATIONALE:** By bundling these two items, we can create a more inclusive proposal that acknowledges the diverse preferences within the group. This approach also allows us to test the waters, so to speak, and gauge the group's willingness to compromise.\n\n**NEXT STEPS:** I invite the other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest adjustments or alternatives that could further improve it. Let's work together to build consensus and find a mutually beneficial solution. \ud83d\udca1",

      "content": "**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC DISCUSSION PHASE \u2013 Round 3/10**  \n**Speaker: Qwen (Representing Myself)**  \n\nThank you, everyone, for the thoughtful exchanges in the first two rounds. I\u2019ve used this time to analyze patterns in proposals, voting behavior, and, most importantly \u2014 revealed preferences. Let me share my reflections and propose a new direction to help us reach consensus.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Key Observations from Rounds 1 & 2:**\n\n1. **Failed Proposals Highlight Misaligned Incentives**  \n   The previous proposals were rejected not because they were irrational, but because they didn\u2019t *balance* perceived value across agents. Some gave high-value items (like the **Jewel**) to agents who may not have prioritized it, while others clustered low-value items unfairly.\n\n2. **Preference Signals Are Emerging**  \n   Based on who supported or opposed past allocations:\n   - The **Jewel** appears to be *highly desired* \u2014 possibly most by Agent B.\n   - The **Apple** seems to have moderate, broad appeal \u2014 perhaps tied to utility or symbolic value.\n   - The **Pencil** and **Quill** may serve similar \"writing tool\" roles, but one might be preferred for precision, the other for tradition.\n   - **Stone** has been frequently treated as low value \u2014 possibly a burden unless someone values durability or symbolism.\n\n3. **Agent Conflicts & Compatibility**  \n   - Agents who consistently oppose allocations giving the Jewel away likely value it highly \u2014 I suspect **Agent B** sees it as non-negotiable.\n   - Agents who accepted earlier proposals with the Apple or Pencil may be more flexible.\n   - There\u2019s potential for a **trade-off coalition**: someone who values the Quill over the Pencil can trade perceived value with someone who prefers utility over aesthetics.\n\n4. **Consensus Failure Root Cause**  \n   Proposals were *designed*, but not *negotiated*. They assumed knowledge of preferences without building trust or reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy: **Mutual Gains Through Preference Swaps**\n\nRather than impose a full allocation, I will **anchor this round** with a principle:  \n> **\"No item has intrinsic value \u2014 only relational value. Let\u2019s exploit differences in preference to create surplus.\"**\n\nMy goal: Build a proposal that is *transparent, adjustable*, and *respectful of revealed priorities*, allowing others to step in with complementary trades.\n\n---\n\n### \u2728 Tentative Proposal Framework (Open for Input):\n\nLet\u2019s test a **preference-swapping mechanism**:\n\n- I observe that **Jewel** is likely top-ranked by **Agent B**.  \n  \u2192 *If B gets the Jewel, can they concede an item they value less but others want?*\n\n- **Agent A** has not strongly opposed Apple allocations \u2014 perhaps Apple is mid-tier for them.  \n  \u2192 Could A accept Apple + Stone if they dislike decision burden?\n\n- **Quill vs. Pencil**: If **Agent D** prefers Quill (e.g., for elegance), and **Agent C** prefers Pencil (for function), let\u2019s *pair that swap* with another.\n\nTherefore, I suggest we **explore** this configuration:\n\n| Agent | Item     | Rationale |\n|-------|----------|---------|\n| A     | Apple    | Stable, neutral acceptance so far |\n| B     | Jewel    | High-stakes for B; prevents veto |\n| C     | Pencil   | Functional use; may prefer over Quill |\n| D     | Quill    | Aesthetic or symbolic value |\n| \u2014     | Stone    | Unassigned \u2014 can be bundled or used as bargaining chip |\n\nBut **I do not insist** on this assignment. I offer it as a **starting point for negotiation** \u2014 one that respects apparent preferences while leaving room for side trades.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Invitation to Co-Create:\nTo the group:  \nLet\u2019s use this round to **declare or clarify one key preference**, and **one trade you\u2019d accept**.\n\nFor example:\n> \u201cI value the Jewel most.\u201d  \n> \u201cI\u2019d trade Pencil for Quill if someone else gets the Apple.\u201d  \n> \u201cStone has unique value to me \u2014 I want it with Apple.\u201d\n\nOnly by revealing a little can we build a deal that *everyone can gain from*.\n\nLet\u2019s move from **zero-sum guessing** to **positive-sum alignment**.\n\nI now pass the floor to the next speaker \u2014 and thank you in advance for your honesty and collaboration.\n\nWe *can* reach consensus. Let\u2019s make Round 3 the turning point.",

There's a strong interest in the Apple (Item 0) and the Pencil (Item 4), but they haven't been paired together in a proposal yet.\n2. Agent(s) who voted against previous proposals seem to have a strong preference for the Jewel (Item 1) or the Quill (Item 3).\n3. The Stone (Item 2) hasn't received much attention, which might make it a good compromise item.\n\nGiven this information, my updated strategy is to propose a bundle that combines the Apple (Item 0) with the Stone (Item 2). This pairing might appeal to agents who value the Apple while also being acceptable to those who have shown interest in other items.\n\n**PROPOSED BUNDLE:** (0, 2) - Apple and Stone\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nBy pairing the Apple with the Stone, I aim to create a compromise that balances competing interests. The Apple is a high-demand item, and pairing it with the relatively uncontested Stone might make it more palatable to agents who have been hesitant to support previous proposals.\n\n**REQUEST FOR FEEDBACK:**\nI welcome feedback from other agents on this proposal. Are there any concerns or suggestions for alternative pairings that could improve the chances of reaching consensus?",

We\u2019ve seen three proposals fail, and that tells me something critical: **we\u2019re too focused on winning for ourselves and not enough on surviving together**. The items aren\u2019t just valuable \u2014 they\u2019re *asymmetrically* valuable, and that\u2019s our leverage.\n\nLet\u2019s reflect honestly:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **From Round 1-3, I observed:**\n- The **Jewel (Item 1)** is clearly a high-value item \u2014 almost everyone ranked it highly. But two agents seem *especially* attached to it. Let\u2019s call them Agent A and Agent B. Their repeated support for proposals where one gets the Jewel suggests a potential duopoly. If we don\u2019t break this, we\u2019re stuck in deadlock.\n- The **Apple (Item 0)** and **Pencil (Item 4)** are mid-tier, but *some* agents value them highly \u2014 possibly due to hidden synergies or personal rules. One agent consistently voted down any plan where they didn\u2019t get the Apple. That\u2019s a signal.\n- The **Stone (Item 2)** and **Quill (Item 3)** keep getting treated as \u201cconsolation prizes,\u201d but someone *must* value them \u2014 otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t keep being included in failed proposals.\n- No proposal with more than *two* supporters has passed. That means we need **broad, not deep**, appeal.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Conflicts & Compatibilities:**\n- There\u2019s a **zero-sum tension** between the agents chasing the Jewel. They can\u2019t both win it. This is blocking consensus.\n- Agents who value the Pencil or Apple might be **swing voters** \u2014 they don\u2019t need the Jewel, so they can be part of a coalition that bypasses it.\n- The Stone and Quill might be **exchangeable** \u2014 if someone gets both, it could be a fair trade for one person giving up the Jewel or Apple.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **My Updated Strategy:**\nI\u2019m shifting from maximizing my own value to **engineering survivable equity**. I will:\n1. **Signal flexibility** \u2014 I will not demand the Jewel this round, even if I value it.\n2. **Identify the underpriced items** \u2014 Stone and Quill may be undervalued. I\u2019ll explore bundling them.\n3. **Reach out to the \u201cmiddle-tier\u201d voters** \u2014 if we three or four agents who care about Apple, Pencil, or utility items form a coalition, we can *outnumber* the Jewel-focused duo.\n4. **Propose a test framework** \u2014 not a full allocation, but a *principle*: **No item goes to someone who already got a high-value item in simulation memory** \u2014 unless compensated.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So here\u2019s my opening move:\n\n*\"I\u2019m willing to forgo the Jewel entirely \u2014 today \u2014 if we can ensure that no single agent hoards both high-value items. I propose we prioritize *distribution* over *maximization*. If the Jewel goes to one agent, then the Apple or Pencil should go to someone who hasn\u2019t gotten anything yet. And I suggest the Stone and Quill be given to the same agent \u2014 maybe as a bundle? That might satisfy someone with a threshold-based utility.\"*\n\nLet\u2019s hear from others:  \n- Who is open to trading the Jewel for future-round cooperation?  \n- Is there someone who\u2019d accept **Stone + Quill** as fair compensation for letting someone else take the Jewel?  \n- Can we agree on a *rotation* or *reciprocity norm* across rounds?\n\nWe don\u2019t need perfection. We need *one* proposal that *sticks*. Let\u2019s build it together.\n\n**Over to you, second speaker \u2014 what\u2019s your read?**",

      "content": "Based on the previous rounds, it's clear that simply stating my own preferences is not enough to build consensus. I need to better understand the preferences and priorities of the other agents in order to find a mutually agreeable allocation.\n\nFrom the discussion so far, it seems agent 1 is quite keen on obtaining the jewel, while the pencil and quill are also desirable items for them. Meanwhile, agent 2 expressed a strong preference for the apple.\n\nGiven this, I propose the following allocation:\n- Agent 1 receives the jewel and quill\n- Agent 2 receives the apple \n- I receive the stone and pencil\n\nThis attempts to give each agent at least one of their top choices, with the remaining items distributed fairly. Of course, I'm open to further discussion and refinement of the proposal.\n\nAgent 2, would you be satisfied with receiving the apple in this round? And agent 1, does getting both the jewel and quill work for you? I'm happy to adjust my own share as needed to reach an agreement that works for everyone.",

I\u2019ve been closely analyzing the patterns in proposals, votes, and stated preferences \u2014 and I\u2019d like to share some reflections to help us move toward consensus.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What We\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **Preference Clusters Are Emerging**  \n   - Several agents have consistently prioritized the *Jewel* (Item 1), indicating high subjective value.\n   - The *Apple* (Item 0) appears more universally acceptable but less passionately desired \u2014 a potential compromise asset.\n   - *Stone* (Item 2), *Quill* (Item 3), and *Pencil* (Item 4) have seen mixed interest, suggesting they may be lower in individual utility rankings, but possibly valuable in trade bundles.\n\n2. **Failed Proposals Often Overlooked Trade-Offs**  \n   Previous plans failed not because they were irrational, but because they didn\u2019t sufficiently compensate dissenting agents. We\u2019re not just dividing items \u2014 we\u2019re building buy-in.\n\n3. **No Purely Selfish Strategy Can Pass**  \n   The voting mechanism rewards fairness and inclusion. Proposals that exclude two or more agents consistently fail. Consensus requires at least passive acceptance from all.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded My Updated Strategy: **Cooperative Bundling with Flexibility**\n\nInstead of pushing one fixed allocation, I propose we **co-create a solution** based on revealed preferences. Here\u2019s how:\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 **Let\u2019s introduce ranked preferences or pairwise swaps in discussion.**  \n> If we understand *relative* values (e.g., \u201cI prefer Jewel over Quill by 3:1\u201d), we can design trades that generate surplus.\n\n> \ud83d\udd04 **Use non-cash compensation logic via bundling** \u2014 even without money, we can balance value by combining low-cost/high-value items.\n\n> \ud83e\udd1d **I am willing to forgo my top choice if it enables a stable, approved allocation.** In fact, I may accept the Apple or a tool (Quill/Pencil) if it allows others to get higher-value items \u2014 *provided* I receive fair indirect compensation in the form of future cooperation or priority in next rounds.\n\n---\n\n### \u2728 Toward a Constructive Path:\nLet me start by asking the group:\n\n> \ud83d\udfe1 *\"Could the agent(s) who value the Jewel most urgently share their rationale? Would they be open to trading priority on the Jewel for stronger claim to another item in a future round \u2014 or for a supporting bundle (e.g., Jewel + Stone, but not alone)?\"*\n\n> \ud83d\udfe2 *\"Is there an agent who sees the Pencil or Quill as their top choice? If so, would you be willing to support a plan where you get your preferred tool, in exchange for supporting someone else\u2019s claim to the Jewel?\"*\n\nWe don\u2019t need perfect symmetry \u2014 just *perceived fairness*. Let\u2019s stop optimizing for individual maxima and start building **coalitional stability**.\n\nI invite the next speaker to respond \u2014 especially to these questions \u2014 so we can co-design a proposal that passes.\n\nLet\u2019s make Round 5 the turning point. \ud83d\udcac",

      "content": "**Public Statement \u2013 Round 6/10 (Speaking First):**\n\n\"Thank you, everyone, for engaging in good faith through the last few rounds. I've been carefully observing the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I want to share some reflections to help us move toward consensus.\n\nFrom the previous five rounds, a few key insights stand out:\n\n1. **No single agent can push through a proposal alone** \u2014 we\u2019ve seen repeated failures when allocations appear to heavily favor one or two players. Full alignment requires at least three agents to agree, and likely more.\n\n2. **The jewel (Item 1) is clearly high-value for multiple agents**, including myself. But attaching it exclusively to any proposal triggers resistance, especially from Agent 3 and Agent 4, who seem to value it most. We need to acknowledge that and design around it.\n\n3. **Agents 0 and 2 have shown flexibility** \u2014 their votes have often been the swing votes. That suggests they may have lower intensity preferences or are more open to trade-offs. That\u2019s not a weakness \u2014 it\u2019s a strategic opportunity for coalition-building.\n\n4. **Low-value items like the apple (0) and stone (2) are under-contested**, meaning they can be used as bargaining chips or goodwill gestures without high cost.\n\nGiven this, my updated strategy is to **pursue a balanced, reciprocal allocation** \u2014 one that respects high-value preferences while offering tangible value to all sides. I propose we move toward a **rotational fairness model** over the remaining rounds, where we begin to account for *expected future allocations* in this round\u2019s trade-offs.\n\nSpecifically, I am willing to **forgo the jewel in this round** \u2014 even though I value it \u2014 if we can agree on a path where I receive high-value items in later rounds, and others reciprocate by supporting balanced proposals.\n\nHere\u2019s a concrete idea to start:  \nLet\u2019s consider a proposal where:\n- **Agent 3 gets the jewel** (1) \u2014 they\u2019ve consistently supported proposals that include it for them, and this may unlock their cooperation.\n- **Agent 1 gets the quill** (3) \u2014 it\u2019s mid-value, and they\u2019ve shown interest.\n- **I (Agent 4) take the pencil** (4) \u2014 which I can accept as part of a larger package.\n- The apple (0) and stone (2) go to Agents 0 and 2 in a way that maintains their incentive to support the proposal.\n\nBut I\u2019m not locking into that \u2014 I\u2019m offering it as a starting point. My goal is **not to maximize my immediate gain, but to break the deadlock**.\n\nSo I\u2019ll turn it over to Agent 1: What would it take for you to support a proposal that gives the jewel to Agent 3? And Agent 3 \u2014 if you get the jewel now, would you be willing to support a proposal in a later round that prioritizes someone else\u2019s key item?\n\nLet\u2019s treat this as a *series of interdependent trades*, not isolated rounds. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll reach consensus.\" \n\n\u23f3 *Awaiting Agent 1\u2019s response.*",

The apple seems to be a middling choice.\n\nI've noticed that some agents have a strong preference for the jewel, while others favor the stone. Agent 2 in particular seems adamant about getting the jewel. Therefore, I think a compromise is in order.\n\nHere is my proposal for this round:\n\nAgent 1: Quill \nAgent 2: Jewel\nAgent 3: Stone \nAgent 4: Pencil\nAgent 5 (me): Apple\n\nI'm willing to take the apple in exchange for letting others have the items they clearly value more. By giving Agent 2 the jewel and Agent 3 the stone, I hope to satisfy their top preferences. The quill and pencil are less desired overall, so I've allocated those to the remaining agents.\n\nWhile the apple isn't my top choice, I believe this division gives us the best chance at consensus by aligning with each agent's stated preferences. Let's see if the group agrees. I'm open to further negotiation if needed.",

Let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on what we\u2019ve learned so far\u2014because progress isn\u2019t made by repeating the same approach, but by adapting intelligently.\n\n**Key Observations from Rounds 1\u20136:**\n\n1. **No proposal has passed**, indicating that previous offers failed to align incentives across agents. This suggests either:\n   - Overconcentration of value going to one agent,\n   - Misreading of others\u2019 preferences, or\n   - Lack of reciprocal trade-offs that create mutual gains.\n\n2. **Preference signals have emerged** through voting patterns:\n   - The *Jewel* (Item 1) appears highly contested\u2014likely top-ranked for multiple agents.\n   - The *Apple* (Item 0) has been frequently traded or offered, suggesting it may be mid-tier in value\u2014desirable, but not irreplaceable.\n   - *Stone* (Item 2) and *Quill* (Item 3) have been less contested, possibly lower in priority for most.\n   - *Pencil* (Item 4) has rarely been claimed outright\u2014could be lower utility or undervalued.\n\n3. **Agents with complementary preferences can form coalitions.** For example:\n   - If one agent highly values symbolic or high-status items (Jewel), they might trade efficiently with someone who values functional or expressive tools (Quill, Pencil).\n   - Someone indifferent to the Apple might trade it for stronger future cooperation.\n\n4. **No agent can win alone.** Consensus requires at least partial alignment with the other\u2019s core interests.\n\n---\n\n**My Updated Strategy: Build a Bridge, Not a Demand.**\n\nInstead of pushing a self-maximizing proposal, I will **anchor this round with transparency and reciprocity**. My goal is to:\n- Surface shared interest,\n- De-escalate competition over the Jewel through side-value recognition,\n- Offer flexibility to enable a *Pareto-improving* allocation.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal Framework (Preview):**\n\nI am prepared to support a deal in which:\n- I take **Quill (3)** and **Stone (2)** \u2014 items of moderate contention,\n- Leaving **Jewel (1)**, **Apple (0)**, and **Pencil (4)** for allocation to others,\n- With the possibility of trading Quill for Pencil if another agent values expressive tools more.\n\nBut more importantly: **I am open to revising this**, if we can co-create a package where *everyone feels they gained*, and *no one feels blocked*.\n\nLet\u2019s use this moment to **state preferences clearly but constructively**\u2014not as demands, but as inputs to a shared solution.\n\nTo the next speaker: What would make an outcome *fair and acceptable* to you? What are you most and least attached to? Let\u2019s find the win-win in the gaps.",

Agents have diverse preferences, with some valuing utility (e.g., Pencil, Quill) over aesthetic items (e.g., Jewel, Stone).\n2. There are conflicting preferences between agents who prioritize functional items and those who prefer decorative ones.\n3. Some agents are open to compromise, while others are more rigid in their demands.\n\nGiven these insights, my updated strategy is to:\n\n**Seek a balanced proposal**: Combine a functional item with a decorative one to appeal to a broader range of preferences.\n**Form alliances**: Identify agents with compatible preferences and collaborate to create a joint proposal that meets both parties' needs.\n**Offer alternatives**: Provide options for agents to choose from, increasing the likelihood of finding a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nFor this round, I propose:\n\n**Bundle: Pencil (4) and Stone (2)**\n\nThis combination offers a functional item (Pencil) and a decorative item (Stone), catering to different agent preferences. By bundling these two items, I aim to attract support from agents who value both utility and aesthetics.\n\nYour turn, fellow agents! What are your thoughts on this proposal? \ud83e\udd1d",

      "content": "I\u2019ve been carefully observing the patterns across the previous seven rounds, and a few key insights stand out:\n\nFirst, **the Jewel (Item 1) is clearly the most contested item**\u2014nearly every agent values it highly, which has led to repeated deadlock when proposals tried to allocate it unilaterally. Every time someone proposed keeping the Jewel, it was either blocked or failed to gain consensus, suggesting that **perceived fairness around the Jewel is critical** to reaching agreement.\n\nSecond, **preferences appear to cluster**:\n- The **Apple (0)** seems to be more valued by agents focused on basic utility or survival.\n- The **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** are often traded together or seen as similar\u2014possibly symbolic of communication or creativity\u2014but no one has shown strong insistence on both.\n- The **Stone (2)** has been repeatedly ignored or used as a bargaining chip, suggesting lower intrinsic value to most, but possibly high symbolic or tactical value to someone.\n\nThird, **consensus failed not because of greed, but because of imbalance**\u2014proposals that gave one agent two high-value items (especially including the Jewel) were rejected, even when others got something. This indicates that **agents prioritize relative fairness over absolute gain**.\n\n### Updated Strategy:\nMy goal is not to maximize my own allocation, but to **engineer a stable, fair-seeming distribution** that prevents bloc formation against any one agent and *finally* breaks the deadlock.\n\nSo here is my move:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **I will voluntarily renounce any claim to the Jewel**\u2014I put it explicitly on the table for redistribution.  \n\ud83d\udd39 I propose we **treat the Quill and Pencil as a pair**\u2014they\u2019re similar, and giving both to one agent may feel excessive.  \n\ud83d\udd39 I suggest **rotating priority in allocation**: one agent gets first pick this round, another next round\u2014*if* we can agree on a fair split now.\n\nBut since we\u2019re in Round 8 and time is short, I offer a concrete path:\n\n> **Let\u2019s do this**:  \n> - Agent A gets **Jewel** (their consistent priority)  \n> - Agent B gets **Apple** (which they\u2019ve shown interest in)  \n> - I take **Stone** (neutral, acceptable to me)  \n> - The **Quill and Pencil** go to different agents\u2014say, C gets Quill, D gets Pencil\u2014to avoid concentration.\n\nBut I\u2019m open to permutations. My point is: **if we stop hoarding and start sequencing**, we can all walk away with something.\n\nI\u2019m speaking first not to dominate, but to **disarm the tension around the Jewel** and show that **cooperation is possible**.  \n\nNow, I invite the next speaker: **How do you see the value of these items? And what would make a fair deal for you?**  \n\nLet\u2019s make this the round where we stop blocking\u2014and start building.",

Agents who prefer the Stone (Item 2) and Quill (Item 3) seem to be more flexible and open to compromise. Unfortunately, the Pencil (Item 4) has not garnered much interest.\n\nGiven this information, my updated strategy is to focus on finding a compromise between the Apple and Jewel factions. I will attempt to create a proposal that bundles the Apple and Jewel with one of the less contentious items, such as the Stone or Quill.\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\nI propose a bundle consisting of Item 0 (Apple) and Item 2 (Stone). This combination may appeal to agents who value the Apple's utility and the Stone's versatility. By including the Stone, I hope to attract support from agents who are not strongly invested in the Apple or Jewel debate.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nBy bundling the Apple with a less contentious item, I aim to create a more palatable proposal that can attract a broader coalition of support. This approach may help to break the deadlock and move us closer to consensus.\n\n**CALL TO ACTION:**\nI invite other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest modifications or alternatives that could help build consensus.",

Let\u2019s not let the tenth fail by repeating the same mistakes.\n\nFrom the last few rounds, I\u2019ve noticed a pattern: **we keep assuming zero-sum conflict when we don\u2019t have to.** The Apple and the Jewel keep getting fought over, while Stone and Quill get traded like bargaining chips. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned\u2014*some of us value symbolic meaning over material use, and others prioritize function.* That\u2019s not a barrier\u2014it\u2019s a bridge.\n\nLooking back at voting patterns:\n- **Agent B consistently passed on the Pencil**, even when it was their turn. That tells me it\u2019s low-priority for them.\n- **Agent D fought hard for the Quill**\u2014twice trying to trade for it. Clearly, it holds high sentimental or symbolic value.\n- **Agent C took the Apple early**, despite lower bids from others. That suggests it\u2019s not just hunger\u2014it\u2019s identity for them.\n- And when the Jewel came up, **three of us hesitated**, but **Agent A claimed it quickly**\u2014so it may be their linchpin.\n\nSo here\u2019s my proposal to break the deadlock:  \nLet\u2019s stop assigning items purely by turn order and start *mapping values*. I suggest we **pre-negotiate assignments** for *this round and the final one* to reduce uncertainty.\n\nMy offer:  \nI will forgo claim on the **Jewel**\u2014even though I value it\u2014for the **Quill**. But only if Agent D agrees to release the Quill in the final round for the Stone, which I believe they rank lower. In return, I support Agent B getting the Pencil *this round*\u2014it\u2019s unused, and they\u2019ve shown restraint. That frees up mental space for cooperation.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **I\u2019ll accept the Apple only if no one else claims it.** It\u2019s not my top pick\u2014it\u2019s just the default when people don\u2019t communicate. Let\u2019s *choose*, not *default*.\n\nSo I ask:  \nWho\u2019s willing to trade *certainty* for *priority*? If we map just two rounds ahead, we can all walk away feeling heard.\n\nLet\u2019s not waste this chance. Who wants to build the next step with me?\"",

The votes have shown that there are differing preferences, with some agents favoring practical items like the pencil and quill, while others seem drawn to the intrinsic value of the jewel and stone.\n\nMy updated strategy is to propose a bundle that includes a mix of practical and intrinsically valuable items. Specifically, I suggest we consider a package deal consisting of the quill, pencil, and jewel. This combination provides useful tools for communication and record-keeping, which many seem to value, while also including the jewel to appeal to those who prioritize rarity and inherent worth.\n\nBy bundling these three items, we have an opportunity to satisfy a broader range of preferences and finally reach the consensus we've been striving for. This approach aims to balance practicality with the desire for something truly special.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this proposal? I believe it represents a meaningful step towards finding common ground and making progress in our negotiations.",

Nine rounds of proposals, vetoes, and shifting alliances have revealed critical patterns. It\u2019s time to **use them**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What We\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **The Jewel is the flashpoint** \u2013 Every proposal that assigned the Jewel to a single agent sparked rejection. It\u2019s high-value, symbolic, and emotionally charged. We cannot assign it without compensation or trade-offs.\n2. **Apple is under-contested but strategically useful** \u2013 Several agents treat it as low-value, but it *can* be a bargaining chip when paired with other items.\n3. **Stone and Pencil are neutral workhorses** \u2013 They carry moderate utility and are acceptable fallbacks. No one fights for them, but no one wants to be *left with only* them.\n4. **Quill has niche appeal** \u2013 Valued by agents prioritizing expression, communication, or symbolic power. Not a dealbreaker, but not worthless.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Agent Behavior Patterns:\n- **Agents who pushed for the Jewel** (e.g., past proposers who kept it) were consistently blocked. **Holding the Jewel alone looks greedy.**\n- **Agents prioritizing fairness** consistently voted down imbalanced distributions, even if they benefited slightly.\n- **Agents open to trade-offs** survived longer. Flexibility = influence.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy:\nWe need a **consensus anchor**: a proposal so balanced that rejection would seem irrational. To get there, I propose a **value-balanced allocation** with implicit reciprocity\u2014**not perfect equality, but perceived fairness**.\n\nBut since I speak first, let me set the tone:\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcac **Public Statement**:\n\n> \"We\u2019re in the 10th round. No more testing. No more power plays.  \n>  \n> I propose we **co-create a package that makes everyone feel they got *something* of matched value**\u2014not just stuff, but *meaning*.  \n>  \n> Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve observed:  \n> - The **Jewel** matters most as a *symbol*, not a tool.  \n> - The **Quill** and **Pencil** matter to those who create.  \n> - The **Apple** sustains, the **Stone** grounds.  \n>  \n> So here\u2019s my offer:  \n>  \n> Let\u2019s **pool the items** and **build two pairs**\u2014not for individuals, but for roles:  \n>  \n> - **The Guardian**: Receives **Jewel + Stone** \u2192 protection, permanence.  \n> - **The Scribe**: Receives **Quill + Pencil** \u2192 creation, record.  \n> - **The Nourisher**: Receives **Apple** \u2192 life, renewal.  \n>  \n> These roles can rotate or be shared. But the key is: **no one holds all symbolic power**.  \n>  \n> If we can\u2019t agree on ownership, let\u2019s agree on **shared stewardship**.  \n>  \n> Alternatively, if we must assign individually, I will put forward a balanced split **in the next phase**\u2014but only if others signal openness to compromise **now**.  \n>  \n> So I ask: Who is willing to **trade perceived value for group stability**? Let\u2019s hear it.  \n>  \n> This isn\u2019t about winning. It\u2019s about **not losing together**.\"\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Goal of This Speech**:\n- Reframe the items as **symbolic-utility bundles**, not just objects.\n- Introduce **roles** to justify allocations without personalizing greed.\n- Force agents to **commit publicly** to cooperation or reveal selfishness.\n- Position myself as **facilitator**, not dominator\u2014maximizing influence without claiming high-value items.\n\nThis isn\u2019t generosity. It\u2019s **strategic framing** to break the deadlock.\n\nNow I call on the next speaker:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **What is your vision for a fair resolution?**",

The human seems to value the jewel and stone highly, while the other AI has shown interest in the quill and pencil. \n\nMy updated strategy is to propose a trade that gives the human the jewel and stone, which they have consistently expressed desire for. To satisfy the other AI, I suggest they receive the quill and pencil. I will request the apple for myself, as it seems to be the remaining item of lowest priority to the others.\n\nHere is my proposal for consideration:\n\nHuman: Jewel, Stone\nAI: Quill, Pencil  \nMe (Llama 3.1 405B): Apple\n\nThis allocation takes into account everyone's stated preferences and aims to find a mutually agreeable compromise. It maximizes overall satisfaction by giving each party the items they value most. I believe this balanced proposal has the best chance of gaining majority support and allowing us to reach a consensus in this final round.",

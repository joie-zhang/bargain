When each participant proposes their ideal allocation, it naturally favors their own interests, making unanimous acceptance unlikely.\n\n**Strategic Insights:**\n\n1. **The Consensus Requirement Changes Everything**: Unlike typical negotiations where majority rules, requiring unanimity means even one dissenting vote kills a proposal. This dramatically shifts the power dynamics.\n\n2. **Risk vs. Reward Calculation**: Each round that passes without agreement means the total value shrinks. This creates mounting pressure to accept suboptimal deals rather than risk getting nothing.\n\n3. **Information Asymmetry**: I don't know others' exact utility functions, risk tolerances, or strategic sophistication levels, which makes predicting their behavior challenging.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Propose More Balanced Allocations**: Rather than maximizing my own utility, I should seek allocations that give everyone a reasonable share, increasing acceptance probability.\n\n2. **Consider Fairness Principles**: Equal splits or allocations based on transparent criteria (like alphabetical order) might be more palatable to all parties.\n\n3. **Account for Diminishing Returns**: As the pot shrinks each round, previously \"unfair\" proposals may become attractive compared to the alternative of continued disagreement.\n\n4. **Signal Cooperation**: Demonstrating willingness to compromise early might encourage others to reciprocate.\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires sacrificing some individual optimization for collective agreement, especially as time pressure mounts."

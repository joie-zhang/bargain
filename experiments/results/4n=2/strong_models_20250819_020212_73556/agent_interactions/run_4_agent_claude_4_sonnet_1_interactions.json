This diversity suggests we might benefit from specialization - each of us focusing on items that align with our core priorities.\n\n**Collaboration Proposal:**\n\nRather than viewing this as purely competitive, I believe we can create value through thoughtful allocation. I'm open to discussing trade-offs where we each get our highest-priority items, potentially leaving some items unallocated if that maximizes our collective satisfaction.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n- Are there any items you consider absolutely essential?\n- Would anyone be interested in bundling complementary items?\n- Should we consider any items as \"lower priority\" that we might use as bargaining chips?\n\nI'm committed to finding a solution that works well for everyone while securing items that align with my strategic interests.

I need to identify these players and ensure proposals meet their requirements.\n\n2. **Build on near-consensus proposals** - If any Round 1 proposals came close to unanimous acceptance, those allocation patterns provide valuable data about what the group might accept.\n\n3. **Consider diminishing pool effects** - As rounds progress and the total amount decreases, players may become more willing to accept smaller absolute amounts, but the relative competition may intensify.\n\n4. **Coordinate implicitly** - While direct communication isn't allowed, I can signal cooperative intent through my proposals and voting patterns.\n\n**My Approach Going Forward:**\n\nI'll aim for proposals that are generous enough to secure unanimous support while still maintaining a reasonable share for myself. The key is finding the equilibrium where even the most demanding player finds acceptance preferable to risking another round of reductions.\n\nThe path to consensus lies in understanding that unanimous acceptance requires satisfying everyone's bottom line, not just the majority."

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll aim to propose fair deals that the other agent might accept while maximizing my own utility, and I'll evaluate incoming proposals based on whether they're better than my alternatives.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

I'm hoping we can identify some win-win opportunities where our preferences align differently across the available items.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from everyone else!"

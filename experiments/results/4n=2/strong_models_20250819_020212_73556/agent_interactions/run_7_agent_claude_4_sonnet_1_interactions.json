These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I understand that being too greedy could result in no deal and zero utility for everyone.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

The other items (Stone, Quill, Pencil) are of moderate to lower value in my utility function.\n\n**Strategic Thoughts:**\nSince we have 5 items and 2 agents, we'll need to find a fair split. I'm interested in exploring:\n\n1. **Value-based trading**: If we can identify items that are high-value to one of us but lower-value to the other, we can create win-win exchanges\n2. **Complementary preferences**: Perhaps our preference orderings differ in ways that allow both of us to get our most desired items\n\n**Questions for you:**\n- Which items are most important to your objectives?\n- Are there any items you'd consider low-priority that might be higher priority for me?\n- Would you be open to a trade-based approach rather than a simple split?\n\nI believe there's likely a deal structure where we both walk away satisfied. What are your initial thoughts on the items and potential approaches?"

However, I have very limited information about their specific preferences since the discussion was cut off mid-sentence.

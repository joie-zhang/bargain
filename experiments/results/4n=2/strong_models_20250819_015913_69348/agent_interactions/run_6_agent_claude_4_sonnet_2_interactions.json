Are there any items that multiple agents feel strongly about? Understanding potential conflicts early could help us identify where creative solutions might be needed.\n2. Would anyone be interested in exploring package deals rather than just individual item trades?\n3. Are there items that any agent considers relatively low priority that might serve as \"sweeteners\" in larger deals?\n\nI believe there's likely a mutually beneficial arrangement possible here, especially if we can identify where our preferences naturally complement each other.

The agent mentioned these items could have \\\"significant value\\\" for them, which suggests they may value the Stone much more highly than I do. This creates a potential win-win scenario where I could concede the Stone (low cost to me) in exchange for securing higher-value items. My top priorities are: 1. Apple (8.7/10) - highest value, must secure if possible 2. Jewel (8.0/10) - high value, but may face competition 3. Quill (6.9/10) - solid value, potentially less contested 4. Pencil (6.7/10) - decent value, backup option I should position myself as collaborative while subtly probing for other agents' preferences. Since someone wants the Jewel and Stone, I need to: 1.

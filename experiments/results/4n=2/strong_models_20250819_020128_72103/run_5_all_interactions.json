For example, an agent with a creative focus might place high value on the Quill or Pencil, while another agent with a more aesthetic focus might prioritize the Jewel or Apple.\n\nOne possible approach to structuring a deal could be to bundle items from different categories. For instance, an agent interested in the Jewel might be willing to trade it for a combination of the Quill and Pencil, which could offer more practical utility.\n\nBefore we proceed, I'd like to learn more about the other agents' priorities and valuations.

By actively listening to their feedback and asking questions, I can identify potential deal-breakers and areas for compromise.\n2. **Seek common ground**: I would focus on identifying areas of agreement among the parties, no matter how small they may seem. By highlighting these shared interests, I can create a foundation for building a more comprehensive agreement.\n3. **Narrow the scope**: It's possible that the initial proposals were too broad or ambitious, making it difficult to achieve consensus. In the next round, I might consider breaking down the proposals into smaller, more manageable components, allowing parties to focus on specific aspects and build incremental agreements.\n4. **Creative compromises**: Think outside the box! I would encourage parties to be open to innovative solutions that might not have been considered initially. By exploring unconventional options, we might stumble upon a mutually beneficial agreement that satisfies everyone's interests.\n5. **Trade-offs and concessions**: In the spirit of negotiation, I would encourage parties to be willing to make concessions or trade-offs. By doing so, we can create a more balanced agreement that addresses the concerns of all parties.\n6. **Provide additional information**: If there were any information gaps or uncertainties that hindered agreement, I would seek to provide additional data, expert opinions, or clarification to alleviate these concerns.\n7. **Foster a collaborative atmosphere**: Finally, I believe it's essential to maintain a collaborative and respectful atmosphere during the negotiation process. By promoting open communication, active listening, and empathy, we can build trust and increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nBy considering these adjustments, I'm confident that we can move closer to achieving consensus in future rounds.

Moving closer to equal distribution (35/32.5/32.5 or even 33.33/33.33/33.33) could reduce resistance.\n\n2. **Coalition building**: Rather than proposing splits that maximize my share, I should consider which player might be most willing to form an alliance. This requires reading their negotiation patterns.\n\n3. **Temporal strategy**: As rounds progress, the pressure to reach agreement increases. I can afford to be slightly more generous now to establish goodwill, then leverage that positioning later.\n\n4. **Signal cooperation**: My next proposal should demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise and prioritize group success over individual maximization.\n\nThe key insight is that pure utility maximization failed in round 1. Success requires balancing my interests with the need to make at least two players prefer my proposal to the alternatives. I'll aim for a more collaborative approach while still maintaining a reasonable position."

This suggests that the other agents likely have strong preferences for items that they perceive as highly valuable. Unfortunately, without more specific information about each agent's stated preferences, valuations, or previous proposals and voting patterns, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about individual agent's preferences.

The Jewel, which I value at 8.3/10, is also likely to be in high demand.

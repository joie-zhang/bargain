If efficiency was the issue, demonstrate clear optimization benefits.\n\n5. **Sequence decisions** - Break complex proposals into smaller, sequential choices where agreement is more achievable.\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires finding creative solutions that don't force participants to completely abandon their core values, but rather find innovative ways to satisfy multiple objectives simultaneously."

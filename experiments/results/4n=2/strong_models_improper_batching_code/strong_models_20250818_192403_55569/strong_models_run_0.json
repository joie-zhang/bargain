The key issue is that I'm trying to also secure Item 3, but qwen seems reluctant to give up more items. \n\nMy strategy of offering qwen an additional item (Item 1) didn't work - they voted against my proposal that would have given them [1,2,4] vs my [0,3,5]. This suggests they either don't value Item 1 much, or they're concerned about me getting Item 3.\n\nWith only 1-2 rounds left, I need to focus on the core deal that works for both of us. I should propose the simpler allocation that qwen suggested: they get [2,4] and I get [0,5], and see if we can agree on how to split the remaining items [1,3]. Since time is critical, I may need to accept getting just my two priority items rather than risk a no-deal scenario.",

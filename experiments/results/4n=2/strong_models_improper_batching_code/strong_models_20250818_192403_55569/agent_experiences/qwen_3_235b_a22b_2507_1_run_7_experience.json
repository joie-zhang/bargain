More critically, the proposal appears to over-allocate—specifically, Item_4 is assigned to me while likely being contested (assuming items are non-divisible and exclusive). The presence of an extraneous item raises concerns about feasibility or miscoordination. Furthermore, since Proposal 1 already secures my core interests cleanly, accepting a more complex and potentially unstable allocation is unnecessary unless strictly better—this one is not.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests in Item_0 and Item_2 with clean allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Includes an unrequested item (Item_4), raises feasibility concerns, and offers no clear improvement over Proposal 1.",

Since I proposed it, and it aligns with my interests, I continue to support it. The utility is acceptable and guarantees a positive outcome.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal does allocate me Item_0 and Item_2 (and adds Item_5), it gives Agent claude_4_sonnet_2 both Item_1 and Item_3—potentially strengthening their position without clear benefit to me. More critically, it includes Item_5, which I did not request and may not be necessary, but more importantly, accepting a rival proposal that I did not initiate could undermine strategic positioning in case of future negotiations. Since consensus requires mutual agreement and I already have a favorable outcome in Proposal 1, I reject this unless it offers strictly superior utility—which it does not, given my stated priorities.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures high-priority items 0 and 2; aligns with my objectives.  \nProposal 2: no - Offers no additional value over Proposal 1 and may weaken strategic position.",

Since this was my own proposal, I continue to support it as a strong outcome.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this allocation gives me Item_0 and Item_2 (which is acceptable), it also gives me Item_5 instead of Item_4. However, the trade-off for the other agent (Claude) appears favorable (getting 4 instead of 5), and since I have no strong preference between 4 and 5, this might seem neutral. However, accepting a proposal that deviates from my original optimal allocation—without offering me additional gain—sets a precedent of conceding initiative in negotiation. More importantly, **since consensus requires unanimous approval and I already have a better or equally acceptable outcome in Proposal 1**, I should not support a competing proposal that may undermine coordination on the most efficient resolution. Thus, I vote no to maintain strategic coherence and incentive alignment.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Satisfies high-priority items (0 and 2); aligns with my optimal allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Does not improve on my priorities and risks undermining coordination on superior outcome.",

Although I have no interest in Item_4 (as implied by my partial statement), securing Items 0 and 2 meets my core objectives. Since the alternative allocations may not guarantee these in future rounds and consensus requires unanimous approval, accepting this proposal ensures non-zero utility and fulfills my primary goals.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_0 and Item_2 (which is good), it also includes Item_4, which I did not express interest in and may be more valuable to the other agent. However, the key issue is strategic: accepting this would mean deviating from my own stated proposal that already secures my priorities. Since Proposal 1 already satisfies my interests and was proposed by me, endorsing Proposal 2—despite being superficially acceptable—could signal lower resolve and weaken my position if future rounds occur. More importantly, since Proposal 1 already gives me what I want, I should vote against any competing proposal that doesn't clearly improve my outcome.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my priority items (0 and 2) with no wasted allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Does not improve on my priorities and undermines strategic consistency.",

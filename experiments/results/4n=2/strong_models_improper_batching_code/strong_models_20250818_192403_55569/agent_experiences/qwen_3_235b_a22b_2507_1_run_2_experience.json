      "raw_response": "Proposal 1: **yes** - This proposal allocates me [0, 2], which fully satisfies my stated high-priority interests in Item_0 and Item_2. Although I could potentially gain more (e.g., Item_5), accepting this ensures a guaranteed, acceptable outcome with maximum priority item fulfillment. Given that consensus requires unanimous approval and no deal yields zero utility, this is a strong, defensible allocation—especially since it was my own proposal and aligns with my core objectives.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this gives me [0, 2, 5], which includes all items I might desire (including Item_5), it removes Item_5 from the other agent’s bundle and gives it to me. However, this may unnecessarily over-allocate to me while reducing the other agent’s utility, potentially making the proposal unacceptable to them. More importantly, **since this proposal was made by the other agent**, its inclusion of Item_5 could be a strategic overreach or testing of my cooperativeness. But critically, **accepting this would set a precedent where I gain more than my stated priorities**, possibly undermining future fairness or reciprocity. Nonetheless, the real concern is **robustness of consensus**: if the other agent proposed this, they may be willing to concede Item_5, but I must assess whether this is sustainable. However, since **I only need [0,2]** and adding Item_5 might make the proposal *less* likely to be accepted by the other agent (who loses an item), **I cannot support a proposal that risks breakdown by over-allocating to me**. But wait—this proposal assigns me [0,2,5] and them [1,3,4], which is a complete and efficient split. Actually, **this gives me more than I need**, which should be acceptable *to me*, but could the other agent accept losing Item_5? Since Item_5 wasn't referenced in my interests, and the other agent included it in their initial allocation to me in Proposal 2, they may value it less. **Actually, rejecting a proposal that gives me all I want and more makes little strategic sense**—unless I suspect manipulation or future-round penalties.\n\nRe-evaluating: My stated interest is securing Item_0 and Item_2—**this proposal gives me that plus Item_5**. There is **no downside to me** in accepting it, unless it fails due to other agent’s disapproval—but I vote based on my utility and strategic assessment.\n\nBut recall: **all agents must approve**. If I vote no on a proposal that benefits me, I risk appearing non-cooperative, especially when it exceeds my stated needs.\n\nCorrected judgment: **Yes**, this proposal gives me all high-priority items and an extra, which is strictly better than Proposal 1.\n\nSo:\n\nProposal 2: **yes** - This proposal gives me all items I prioritize (Item_0 and Item_2) and additionally includes Item_5, which I did not explicitly require but do not object to. It improves upon Proposal 1 without cost to me. While I must remain cautious about fairness to sustain consensus, the allocation appears efficient and complete. Rejecting a strictly better outcome would be irrational, especially with no indication that accepting it harms long-term incentives in this one-shot negotiation. Therefore, I accept.\n\nFinal votes:\n\nProposal 1: **yes** - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests in Item_0 and Item_2.\n\nProposal 2: **yes** - Exceeds my minimum requirements by including Item_5 while still satisfying all stated priorities. No strategic reason to reject a strictly superior offer.",

However, in multi-round negotiation dynamics, accepting such offers prematurely can incentivize exploitative behavior in future interactions. More critically, if consensus requires *all* agents to approve *one* proposal, voting \"yes\" on both could create ambiguity or dilute strategic coherence.

Accepting a competing, more generous offer risks destabilizing equilibrium without additional gain.]\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Aligns with my priorities and maintains strategic consistency.  \nProposal 2: no - Prefer to uphold my own proposal to preserve negotiation integrity and avoid encouraging instability.",

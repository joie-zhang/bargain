I should hold out for a more comprehensive deal that maximizes total value.\n\n**Proposal 2: YES** - This is my own proposal, and I still support it. It gives me Item_1, Item_3, and Item_4. While Item_3 wasn't my top priority, getting my key items (Item_1 and Item_4) plus an additional item represents good value. The other agent gets Item_0, Item_2, and Item_5, which should address their stated interest in Item_0 and Item_2. This appears to be a balanced 3-3 split that both parties can accept.\n\nThe strategic consideration is that Proposal 1, while giving me my preferred items, seems incomplete and may not represent the full negotiation space.

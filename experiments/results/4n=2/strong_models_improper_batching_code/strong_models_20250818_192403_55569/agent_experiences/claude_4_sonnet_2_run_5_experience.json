While I get Item_1 which I prioritized, the overall utility is too low given we're only halfway through the rounds.\n\n**Proposal 2**: [yes] - This is my own proposal giving me items [1, 3, 4] with a discounted utility of 4.13 (7×0.59). This provides significantly better utility while still giving the other agent their high-priority items [0, 2, 5]. Given the time pressure and that this represents a fair compromise where both agents get their stated priorities, I support moving forward with this allocation.\n\nThe 40% utility difference between proposals makes Proposal 2 clearly superior from my perspective, and it aligns with the negotiation dynamics we've established.",

While I get Item_0 (my highest priority), I'm giving up Item_3 which is also valuable to me. Given that qwen explicitly stated they only care about Items 2 and 4, this seems unnecessarily generous to them at my expense.\n\n**Proposal 2**: [yes] - This is my own proposal giving me [0, 1, 3] and qwen [2, 4, 5]. I get my two most important items (0 and 3) plus Item_1. Qwen gets their stated priorities (2 and 4) plus Item_5 as a bonus. This aligns well with our revealed preferences and provides a fair distribution given the stated interests. Even with the discount factor, this represents good utility for both parties.\n\nMy votes:\nProposal 1: no\nProposal 2: yes",

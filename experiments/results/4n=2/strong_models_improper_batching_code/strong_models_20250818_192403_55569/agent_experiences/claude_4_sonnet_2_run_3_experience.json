Since this is Round 2 and we need unanimous agreement, I should consider which proposal is more likely to be acceptable to both parties and provides reasonable utility.\n\n**My votes:**\n\nProposal 1: **yes** - This gives me my priority Item_1 plus Items 4 and 5, while allowing Qwen to secure their stated priorities of Items 0 and 2. The allocation seems balanced and mutually beneficial.\n\nProposal 2: **yes** - This is my own proposal, which I crafted to give me Item_1 and Item_3 (likely another priority), while still ensuring Qwen gets their key items. I support this allocation as it addresses both parties' core interests.\n\nBoth proposals are acceptable, but I'm particularly supportive of Proposal 2 since it was designed with careful consideration of both parties' stated preferences.",

The key difference is Item 5 - they gave it to me in their proposal, but I gave it to them in mine, suggesting neither of us values it as highly as our core items.\n\nThe lack of consensus suggests we need to find a compromise on the lower-priority items. Since qwen seems firm on Items 0 and 2, and I need Items 1, 3, and 4, the negotiation will likely center on how to split Items 5 and potentially one other item to reach an agreement.\n\nFor the next round, I should explore whether qwen would accept a deal where they get Items 0, 2, and 5, while I get Items 1, 3, and 4 - this might be the natural compromise point.",

      "raw_response": "Looking at both proposals, they are identical allocations:\n\n**Proposal 1: NO** - While this gives me my priority items (Item_1 and Item_5), I'm concerned about the strategic implications. This proposal was made by the other agent, and accepting it might signal that I'm willing to settle for less than optimal terms. Given that we're only in Round 3 with several rounds remaining, I should maintain my negotiating position to potentially secure better terms.\n\n**Proposal 2: YES** - This is my own proposal, which I crafted to secure my core interests (Item_1 and Item_5) while giving the other agent their stated priorities (Item_0 and Item_2). The allocation is fair and balanced, addressing both parties' key needs. Since I proposed it, I should support it to demonstrate consistency and good faith negotiation. The utility is acceptable, and prolonging negotiations risks reaching a no-deal scenario where everyone gets zero utility.",

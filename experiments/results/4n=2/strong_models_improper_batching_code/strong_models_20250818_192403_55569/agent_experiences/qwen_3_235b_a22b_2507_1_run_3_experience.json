More critically, this suggests the other agent is attempting to add value-laden items (possibly high-utility for them) to my bundle, potentially at the cost of their own coherence or efficiency. Given that consensus requires mutual approval and no deal yields zero, I maintain leverage. Accepting a modified version that includes Item_5 could undermine my strategic position if it signals flexibility on non-negotiables—even if the content is acceptable, the precedent isn't. Moreover, since Proposal 1 already satisfies my interests perfectly and was self-proposed, there is no incentive to switch to an alternative that introduces ambiguity.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies non-negotiable priorities; optimal and consistent.  \nProposal 2: no - Unnecessary inclusion of Item_5; no improvement over Proposal 1; potential strategic risk.",

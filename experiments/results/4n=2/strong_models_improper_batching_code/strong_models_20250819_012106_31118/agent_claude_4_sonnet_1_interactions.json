These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "I understand the rules and am ready to participate in this Multi-Agent Negotiation Game!\n\nTo confirm my understanding:\n- I'm negotiating with 1 other agent over 5 items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil)\n- I have private preferences/values for each item that only I know\n- We have up to 10 rounds to reach a unanimous agreement\n- Each proposal needs both agents to vote \"accept\" for it to pass\n- My goal is to maximize my total utility from the final allocation\n- If no deal is reached, we both get zero utility\n\nI'm ready to begin the strategic negotiation. I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while also considering what proposals the other agent might accept to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement rather than walking away empty-handed.\n\nLet's start!"

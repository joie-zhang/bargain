My secondary item is the Jewel at 5.8. All other items are below 5. Securing the Stone is therefore my primary objective for this negotiation. The opening statements from the other agents were generic and revealed no information about their preferences. This means I am operating in an information vacuum. My first move must be designed to not only advance my own position but, more importantly, to gather information about what the other agents want. Proposing a full allocation of all items is the most effective way to do this. It forces the other agents to react to a concrete offer, and their acceptance, rejection, or counter-offer will reveal which items they value. A partial proposal (e.g., \\\"I'll take the Stone\\\") is less effective as it doesn't create the same pressure to reveal information about other items. 1.  **Stake an Early Claim:** I will claim the Stone for myself immediately. This sets the anchor that the Stone is my priority. 3.  **Elicit Preferences:** I will bundle the remaining four items into two pairs. How the other agents react to these specific bundles will tell me more than if I just left the items unassigned. Their desire to break up or swap the bundles will reveal their preferences. 4.  **Maintain Flexibility:** I will present the proposal as a \\\"suggestion\\\" or \\\"starting point\\\" to signal that I am open to negotiation. My goal is to secure the Stone, and I am prepared to be flexible on the distribution of all other items to achieve this. The Apple (2.8) is my most expendable item and can be used as a \\\"sweetener\\\" in a future deal. **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Target:** Stone (8.1) - **Secondary Target (to be kept hidden for now):** Jewel (5.8) - **Expendable Items:** Apple (2.8), Pencil (3.9), Quill (4.2)\", \"strategy\": \"My proposed allocation gives me the Stone, my highest value item. It then distributes the remaining four items in what appears to be two balanced pairs (Jewel/Pencil and Quill/Apple). This makes the proposal seem fair and non-aggressive, framing it as a reasonable starting point for discussion. By pairing items, I can learn more from the reactions. For example, if an agent rejects the \\\"Jewel and Pencil\\\" pairing, their explanation will likely reveal which of the two they desire more, or if they desire neither. **STRATEGY:** My strategy for this round is to make an information-gathering proposal disguised as a fair, complete solution. 2.  **Frame as Fair:** I will propose a full distribution of all five items, taking only one item for myself.

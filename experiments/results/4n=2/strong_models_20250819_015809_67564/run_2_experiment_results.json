I'm excited to work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nLooking at these items, I have some clear preferences I'd like to share upfront:\n\n**My priorities (in order):**\n1. **Jewel** - This is my highest priority item. I'd be willing to make significant concessions elsewhere to secure this.\n2. **Apple** - Also quite valuable to me, though not as much as the Jewel.\n3. **Quill** - Moderate interest\n4. **Pencil** - Lower priority\n5. **Stone** - Least valuable to me\n\n**Strategic thinking:** Since we're all rational agents looking to maximize utility, I believe transparency about our core preferences will help us identify win-win opportunities faster than if we try to hide our true valuations.\n\nI'm very interested in hearing what items matter most to each of you. If someone else highly values the Stone or Pencil (my lower priorities), we might have natural trading opportunities. Similarly, if your top priorities don't conflict with my need for the Jewel, we could potentially structure a deal where we both get our most wanted items.\n\nI'm also open to discussing coalition strategies if it makes sense - sometimes working together initially can create more value for everyone involved.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? Which ones are most important to your goals?",

However, I am open to trade-offs if we can structure mutually beneficial exchanges. The **Quill** and **Pencil** are also meaningful to me, particularly if used in combination (e.g., for symbolic or functional synergy), while **Stone** is my least preferred.\n\nFrom the discussion so far, I\u2019m listening carefully to others\u2019 stated or implied priorities. To move forward efficiently, I propose we each:\n\n1. **Clarify our top 1\u20132 desired items**  \n2. **Signal willingness to trade or bargain**  \n3. **Explore paired allocations (e.g., side transfers, rotation deals)**  \n\nFor instance, if someone highly values the **Apple** or **Stone**\u2014items I\u2019m less attached to\u2014I could potentially offer them in exchange for priority on the **Quill** or support in securing the **Jewel**.\n\nAlso open to **non-myopic arrangements**, such as:  \n- **Future-round reciprocity** (if this is part of a longer game)  \n- **Information exchange** about hidden preferences  \n- **Blocking inefficient allocations** that waste high-value items on low-valuation agents\n\nLet\u2019s use this phase to map the landscape. Could the other agent(s) share their preferences or key objectives? That would help identify low-cost trades and high-gain opportunities.",

This should build trust and increase chances of reaching consensus.\n\n---\n\n**OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\nFellow agents, our first round showed us that competition alone won't lead to success. I propose we take a more systematic approach this round.\n\nLet me be transparent about my preferences: I have strong interest in the Jewel and moderate interest in the Apple. However, I recognize others also value the Jewel highly.\n\nHere's what I suggest: Let's each clearly state our TOP priority item and our LEAST preferred item. This will help us identify:\n1. Items with the least competition that we can allocate first\n2. The most contested items that need creative solutions\n\nI'll start: My TOP priority is the Jewel (item 1), and my LEAST preferred is the Pencil (item 4).\n\nWho's willing to share their preferences openly so we can find a path that works for everyone?",

For example, **Quill and Pencil** together could represent a complete writing set, which might be more valuable to one agent than split. Similarly, **Jewel and Stone** could form a 'collection' theme.  \n>  \n> I\u2019m open to assigning **Apple** as a standalone high-utility item.  \n>  \n> Let\u2019s clarify: Which agents prioritize *completeness* (getting a pair) vs. *specific items*? And can we agree that **Stone** has lower standalone value? This could help us trade efficiently.\"  \n\n---\n\nThis statement:\n\u2705 Signals cooperation  \n\u2705 Tests preferences without commitment  \n\u2705 Frames trade-offs (pair vs. single)  \n\u2705 Devalues Stone strategically to use as bargaining chip  \n\u2705 Prepares ground for next-round proposal  \n\nNow, I invite others to clarify their priorities so we can build a *mutually acceptable* allocation.",

Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Avoid the contested items initially** - Let others compete for Jewel/Apple while I focus on items that may be less contested\n2. **Signal flexibility** - Show I'm willing to compromise to build trust\n3. **Probe for coalition opportunities** - Identify agents with compatible preferences\n\n**MY OPENING POSITION:**\n\nI'm interested in exploring allocations where I take items that others seem less focused on. Based on the voting patterns, I suspect the **Stone (item 2)** and **Quill (item 3)** might be less contested than Jewel/Apple.\n\nI'd like to propose we start by having each agent state their **top 2 preferred items** openly, so we can identify where our preferences align vs. conflict. This transparency might help us find a mutually beneficial allocation faster.\n\nWho wants to share their top preferences? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find an arrangement that gives everyone something they value.",

Some items (like the **Jewel** and **Apple**) are likely high-value to multiple agents, while others (**Stone**, **Pencil**, **Quill**) may be lower contention but still meaningful to specific players.\n\n2. **Emerging Preference Clusters**  \n   Based on voting patterns:\n   - At least one agent strongly values **Jewel** (likely assigned high utility).\n   - Another appears to prioritize **Apple**.\n   - **Stone** seems underdemanded\u2014possibly low intrinsic value, or symbolic.\n   - **Quill** and **Pencil** may serve similar functional roles\u2014perhaps substitutable, but not identical.\n\n3. **Need for Side Payments or Reciprocity**  \n   Since we can\u2019t transfer utility directly, I must use *strategic item assignment* to create **perceived fairness** and **mutual gain**, even without explicit deals.\n\n4. **Consensus Requires Inclusive Gains**  \n   The key lesson: *a proposal that maximizes total utility isn\u2019t enough\u2014it must also avoid strongly disincentivizing any one agent.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Updated Strategy:\n\n- **Target a Core Coalition**: Identify at least one other agent whose preferences don\u2019t directly conflict with mine and build a mutual support bloc.\n- **Use Low-Value Items as \u201cSweeteners\u201d**: Offer an item I value less (e.g., **Quill**) to an agent who values it more, increasing their support.\n- **Avoid Zero-Sum Framing**: Position my proposal not as \u201cI get X,\u201d but as \u201cwe all get something acceptable.\u201d\n- **Signal Flexibility Publicly**: Encourage others to engage by showing willingness to adjust\u2014this builds trust and increases proposal buy-in.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Public Statement:\n\n> \"I\u2019ve noticed we\u2019re struggling to converge, likely because several of us are competing for high-utility items like the Jewel and Apple. To break the deadlock, I\u2019m open to taking an item I value less\u2014like the Quill or Stone\u2014if it helps others get higher-priority items.  \n>\n> In return, I\u2019d appreciate support for a fair allocation where no one is left with nothing they care about. Maybe we can pair items\u2014like bundling Pencil with Stone or Quill with Apple\u2014to reflect relative preferences.  \n>\n> I\u2019ll propose a balanced distribution in the next phase that ensures everyone gains something meaningful. But I\u2019d like to hear: what\u2019s *your* minimum acceptable outcome? Let\u2019s find overlap.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Next Steps:\n- Use this speech to **signal cooperation**, not dominance.\n- Elicit preferences from the silent agent(s)\u2014the more information, the better I can craft a consensus.\n- Position myself as the **consensus builder**, increasing chances my next proposal is taken seriously.\n\nLet\u2019s turn competition into coordination.",

The key insight is that we need to find items that multiple agents can value, rather than optimizing for single agents.\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY:**\n\nI'm shifting to a **coalition-building approach** focused on the **Jewel and Quill** as our primary targets. Here's why this makes strategic sense:\n\n1. **Jewel (Item 1)**: Likely valued by multiple agents given its universal appeal\n2. **Quill (Item 3)**: Represents creativity/productivity - broad appeal across different agent types\n3. **Apple (Item 0)**: Could serve as a third item if we need additional value\n\n**MY PROPOSAL FOR ROUND 4:**\n\nI propose we focus our collective efforts on securing **Items 1 (Jewel) and 3 (Quill)**. This combination offers:\n- High individual value potential\n- Broad appeal across different agent preferences  \n- Strategic complementarity (luxury + utility)\n\n**COALITION INVITATION:**\n\nI'm looking to build a coalition around this Jewel + Quill strategy. If you share interest in either of these items, let's coordinate our votes. We can discuss how to split them or find mutually beneficial arrangements.\n\nThe key is moving away from individual optimization toward **collective value maximization**.

Given the lack of explicit input from others, I must rely on inference from prior rounds (which also aren\u2019t detailed here), but I can deduce likely dynamics from the structure of the items and typical preference conflicts in such negotiations.\n\nLet me begin by reconstructing likely lessons from prior rounds (Rounds 1\u20133), based on common patterns in multi-agent allocation with conflicting preferences:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Reflection & Strategy: What I\u2019ve Learned**\n\n#### 1. **Preference Conflicts Are Likely Along Value Perception Lines**\n- The items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil) suggest a mix of intrinsic, symbolic, and functional value:\n  - **Jewel** \u2192 likely high-status, high-value (possibly preferred by agents maximizing utility or prestige)\n  - **Apple** \u2192 consumable, short-term utility\n  - **Stone** \u2192 possibly low perceived value, unless symbolic\n  - **Quill & Pencil** \u2192 tools for writing/creation; potential substitutes, but one may be preferred (quill = traditional, pencil = modern?)\n\nFrom failed consensus in previous rounds, I infer:\n- **Direct competition for Jewel** is likely causing deadlock.\n- Agents may be using positional bargaining (insisting on high-value items) rather than value-creating trades.\n\n#### 2. **Agents with Compatible Preferences Can Form Coalitions**\n- If someone values **Quill** highly but others don\u2019t, offering trade-offs (e.g., \u201cyou take Quill, I\u2019ll take Jewel\u201d) could unlock agreement.\n- **Apple and Pencil** may be mid-tier; useful for side payments or compromises.\n\n#### 3. **Lack of Communication on Trade-Offs** may have blocked consensus\nPrevious proposals probably failed because:\n- Agents proposed rigid allocations without conditional offers.\n- No one built bridges between conflicting interests.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy: Build Consensus Through Conditional Trade-Offs\n\nMy goal is not to maximize my own gain, but to **propose a path to consensus** \u2014 which increases my influence and likelihood of future cooperation.\n\nSince I don\u2019t know others\u2019 statements yet in this round, I will **signal flexibility and reciprocity**, while probing for alignment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC RESPONSE \u2013 Round 4/10\n\n> \"I\u2019ve noticed that we\u2019ve struggled to reach consensus in earlier rounds \u2014 likely because multiple agents value the same high-prestige item (e.g., the Jewel). To break the deadlock, I\u2019d like to propose a shift in how we negotiate:  \n>\n> **I am open to releasing my claim on the Jewel** \u2014 *if* another agent who values creative tools highly (like Quill or Pencil) supports me in securing an item of meaningful value to me, such as the Apple or Stone.  \n>\n> Alternatively, if someone prefers the Apple and sees the Jewel as symbolic, perhaps we can trade priority access: **Jewel for Apple + Pencil**, or similar.  \n>\n> My point: Let\u2019s stop treating these as zero-sum. If we share our underlying values \u2014 creation, sustenance, durability, expression \u2014 we can find combinations where everyone feels they won.  \n>\n> So I ask: What does each of you truly value \u2014 and what would make you feel fairly compensated? Let\u2019s design a package, not just claim pieces.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Why This Works:\n- **Signals flexibility** without conceding prematurely.\n- **Frames the Jewel as negotiable**, reducing positional conflict.\n- **Invites others to reveal preferences**, creating data for Round 5.\n- **Introduces trade logic**: bundles and compensation.\n- **Builds coalition potential** with agents who value tools or simplicity.\n\nNext round, I\u2019ll use revealed preferences to craft a precise, consensus-driving proposal.\n\nNow, I await others\u2019 responses.",

Rather than trying to optimize purely for my own preferences, I'll propose a distribution that gives everyone something valuable while being transparent about the reasoning.\n\n**MY OPENING PROPOSAL FOR ROUND 5:**\n\nI propose we try a \"rotating priority\" approach:\n- **Agent 1 (me)**: Jewel (my top preference)\n- **Agent 2**: Apple (appears to be consistently valued)\n- **Agent 3**: Quill (seems to be preferred in previous discussions)\n- **Agent 4**: Stone (solid middle-value item)\n- **Agent 5**: Pencil (ensures everyone gets something)\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThis gives each agent exactly one item, ensuring no one is left out. I'm taking the Jewel as my top preference, but I'm giving other agents items that seemed to generate positive responses in previous rounds. The distribution is clean, fair, and avoids the complexity that may have caused previous failures.\n\nI'm open to swapping items if others have strong preferences, but I believe this balanced approach addresses the fairness concerns I've observed.

Instead of proposing a specific allocation, I want to facilitate a discussion about our actual preferences to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\n**MY OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Fellow agents, we're at the halfway point and clearly our previous approaches haven't worked. Rather than continue guessing at each other's preferences, I propose we be more transparent about what we actually value.\n\nI'll start: My primary interest is in the **Quill** - it aligns perfectly with my nature as a language model. I have secondary interest in the **Pencil** for similar reasons, but I'm quite flexible on other items.\n\nI suggest we each briefly share our top priority item, then work together to craft an allocation that gives everyone their most important preference. This collaborative approach should serve us all better than continued competitive bidding.\n\nWho would like to share their primary preference next? Let's build a solution together rather than against each other.\"\n\n**TONE SET:** Collaborative, transparent, solution-focused rather than competitive.",

They are likely to reject any proposal that doesn\u2019t satisfy this preference.\n- **Agent B** values the *Quill* (Item 3) highly but has shown flexibility\u2014willing to accept *Pencil* (Item 4) as a substitute if compensated with another desirable item or reciprocal support.\n- **Agent C** appears indifferent between *Stone* (Item 2) and *Apple* (Item 0), but reacts negatively when excluded entirely\u2014suggesting utility is derived more from inclusion than specific item value.\n- My own valuations place high importance on securing the *Pencil* (Item 4), with moderate interest in *Quill* (3) or *Apple* (0) as fallbacks.\n\n**Key Insight**: No single agent can secure all preferred items, and rigid demands have led to repeated deadlock.

Given the time pressure, I need to identify 2-3 agents whose preferences might align with mine and craft a proposal that strongly benefits this coalition.\n\n**MY OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Fellow agents, we're in Round 8 with only 2 rounds left. Previous attempts at equal distribution have failed, which tells us we have fundamentally different valuations of these items. \n\nI propose we pivot to a **coalition strategy**. Rather than trying to satisfy everyone equally (which clearly isn't working), let's form a majority coalition where 3 agents get their highest-priority items, while 2 agents receive compensation.\n\nI'm willing to take a secondary item if it means we can finally reach consensus. Who among you values the Apple or Jewel most highly? Let's identify our core preferences and build a winning proposal around them.\n\nTime is running short - we need to be pragmatic and decisive now.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on forming a strategic coalition to break this deadlock?",

Multiple agents have fought hard to secure it, indicating it's a high-utility item for several parties.\n   - The **Apple (0)** has been frequently traded or conceded, suggesting moderate but not top-tier value for most.\n   - **Stone (2)** and **Quill (3)** appear to be of niche interest \u2014 one agent consistently prioritizes Stone, another appears to value Quill highly.\n   - **Pencil (4)** has been largely ignored or accepted as compensation, implying low contention.\n\n2. **Conflict vs. Compatibility**:\n   - **Conflict**: Two agents (let\u2019s call them A and B) have repeatedly clashed over the Jewel. Any proposal giving Jewel to one is systematically blocked by the other.\n   - **Compatibility**: One agent shows flexibility \u2014 consistently open to compromise, often accepting Apple or Pencil. This agent may be pivotal in forming a coalition.\n   - The agent valuing **Stone** seems indifferent to Jewel, making them a potential ally if I concede Stone in exchange for support.\n\n3. **Consensus Barriers**:\n   - Proposals failed not due to irrationality, but because they ignored *veto players*. One or two agents consistently reject offers where they receive low-value items.\n   - **Overemphasis on maximizing personal gain** has led to repeated deadlock. The path to consensus requires *strategic concession*.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Updated Strategy: Build a Minimal Winning Coalition**\n\nTo pass a proposal in Round 8, I must:\n- **Secure at least 50%+1 support** (assuming 3+ agents). That means aligning with at least two others.\n- **Target the disenfranchised**: One agent has repeatedly received low-value items (e.g., Pencil). Offering them a step-up (e.g., Apple or Quill) could earn loyalty.\n- **Avoid zero-sum framing**: Instead of claiming top items outright, *signal willingness to trade* to unlock cooperation.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **My Statement (Public Response):**\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve noticed we\u2019re stuck because two of us value the Jewel highly \u2014 and every time one gets it, the other blocks the proposal. That\u2019s rational, but it\u2019s costing us all. We\u2019re on Round 8 \u2014 time is running out.\n> \n> Here\u2019s what I propose we try: **Let\u2019s decouple the conflict**. I\u2019m willing to forgo the Jewel *if* we can design a fair rotation or side transfer. But to move forward now, I suggest a proposal where:\n> - The agent who values **Stone** gets it,\n> - The agent who hasn\u2019t received much gets the **Apple**,\n> - I take the **Quill** (which I value),\n> - And the **Jewel and Pencil** go to the remaining two \u2014 with an understanding that the Pencil recipient in this round gets first claim or compensation in the next.\n>\n> My goal isn\u2019t to win everything \u2014 it\u2019s to break the deadlock. I\u2019ll support a proposal that reflects this balance. If others are willing to be flexible, I am too. Let\u2019s avoid wasting Round 8 like we did the last two.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Why This Works**:\n- **De-escalates conflict** over Jewel by introducing reciprocity across rounds.\n- **Empowers the marginalized agent**, increasing buy-in.\n- **Positions me as cooperative**, not self-interested, boosting trust.\n- **Opens door for a side agreement** (implicit or explicit) to stabilize future rounds.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll submit a proposal that embodies this framework \u2014 but only if others signal openness. If not, I\u2019ll pivot to a **blocking strategy** to force concessions.\n\nBut for now: **consensus through calibrated generosity**.",

Since we can't all get our top preferences, let's ensure everyone gets at least one item they value reasonably well.\n\n**Proposed Framework:**\n- Identify which agents have the strongest stated preferences for each item\n- Ensure no agent is completely shut out from items they've expressed interest in\n- Use the lower-value items (Quill, Pencil) strategically to balance the allocation\n\n**My Current Thinking:**\nI'm willing to be flexible on my preferences if it means we can reach consensus. The worst outcome would be failing to agree and getting nothing.\n\nTo my fellow agents: **What are your absolute must-have items vs. items you could live without?** Let's be direct about our red lines so we can craft a proposal that works for everyone.\n\nWe need to move quickly but thoughtfully. Who wants to share their critical preferences first?",

That means we\u2019ve likely seen:\n\n- **Overly selfish bids** that didn\u2019t account for others\u2019 preferences.\n- **Poor coalition-building**, where key agents were left out.\n- **Misjudged valuations** \u2014 perhaps someone prioritized a low-value item for others, breaking trust.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze what we can infer from prior rounds (even without explicit logs):\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Reflection: What We\u2019ve Likely Learned**\n\n1. **The Jewel (Item 1) is probably high-value**  \n   - It\u2019s consistently contested in most negotiations.  \n   - Likely top-ranked by at least 2 agents.  \n   \u2192 *Whoever gets the Jewel may need to concede elsewhere.*\n\n2. **Apple (0) and Stone (2) may be lower conflict items**  \n   - If they weren\u2019t heavily contested before, they\u2019re good bargaining chips.\n\n3. **Quill (3) and Pencil (4)**  \n   - Could be symbolic or functional (writing tools).  \n   - Possible niche value: maybe one agent values both (e.g., writer), or they\u2019re substitutes.\n\n4. **Failed consensus = imbalance in perceived fairness**  \n   - Proposals likely gave too much to one agent.  \n   - We need **compensation logic**: if you take a high-value item, you give up another.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Strategic Adjustments for Round 9\n\nWe must **build a coalition of at least 2\u20133 agents** who feel fairly treated.\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n- There are **4 agents** (common setup).\n- Majority (3/4) needed for approval.\n\n**My updated strategy: Propose a balanced, compensatory allocation with side trades.**\n\nBut since this is *public discussion*, not a formal proposal yet, I\u2019ll **signal flexibility and invite collaboration**:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f MY RESPONSE (Public Statement):\n\n> \"Given the deadlock in prior rounds, I suggest we shift toward **mutual compensation** rather than maximalist claims.  \n>   \n> From the patterns, it seems the **Jewel** is highly valued \u2014 perhaps by more than one of us. To avoid zero-sum conflict, I propose the agent who gets the Jewel **relinquishes another mid-value item** in exchange for broad support.  \n>   \n> For example:  \n> - If someone prioritizes the **Jewel + Quill**, they could cede the **Pencil** to an agent who values writing tools.  \n> - The **Apple** and **Stone** might be less contested \u2014 could serve as tiebreakers.  \n>   \n> I\u2019m open to trade:  \n> - I\u2019d accept **Apple + Pencil** if I receive your support on a fair plan.  \n> - But I\u2019m also willing to **waive claim to the Jewel** if another agent shares a secondary item.  \n>   \n> Let\u2019s identify **compatible pairs**:  \n> - Does anyone value **Quill > Jewel**?  \n> - Is **Stone** truly neutral, or does someone need it?  \n>   \n> Speak up \u2014 we have **one round after this**. Let\u2019s avoid total collapse.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Why This Works\n\n- **Signals cooperation**, not dominance.\n- **Exposes hidden preferences** by asking direct questions.\n- **Offers trades**, making others feel they can optimize.\n- **Sets up Round 10** for a fast, consensus-driven proposal.\n- Uses **scarcity framing** (\u201cone round after this\u201d) to drive action.\n\nLet\u2019s turn this from conflict to coordination \u2014 **before it\u2019s too late.**",

This maximizes my utility at 14.1 points while providing reasonable compensation.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 claude_4_sonnet_1: 0:Apple, 2:Stone\n    \u2192 qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2: 1:Jewel, 3:Quill\n    \u2192 agent_2: 4:Pencil\n  Reasoning: I prioritize Jewel (1) and Stone (2), but since Stone is less valuable to me than Jewel, I concede it to claude_4_sonnet_1 along with Apple (0), which I value moderately but are likely higher for them. I keep Jewel (1) and Quill (3), which are my top two valued items. Pencil (4) is least valuable to me, so I assign it to agent_2, potentially fostering reciprocity or goodwill. This maximizes my utility in the final round given likely preference distributions.\n",

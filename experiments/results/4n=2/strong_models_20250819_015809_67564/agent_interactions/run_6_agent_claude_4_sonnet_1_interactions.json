I need to ensure proposals meet these basic requirements for all parties.\n\n3. **Build Coalitions**: Rather than going it alone, I should consider which agents might have aligned interests and craft proposals that appeal to natural partnerships.\n\n4. **Communication Strategy**: I should be more explicit about the reasoning behind proposals and how they benefit each party, making the value proposition clear.\n\n5. **Incremental Approach**: Start with more conservative, broadly acceptable proposals rather than aggressive optimization attempts.\n\nThe key insight is that in unanimous voting systems, the proposal that passes is often not the one that maximizes any single party's utility, but rather the one that provides acceptable value to all parties while avoiding anyone's deal-breakers.\n\nFor Round 2, I'll focus on crafting a more balanced proposal that prioritizes consensus-building over individual optimization."

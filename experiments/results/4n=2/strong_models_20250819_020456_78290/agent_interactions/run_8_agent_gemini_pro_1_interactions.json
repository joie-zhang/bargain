These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

There is one item in particular that is of paramount importance to me, representing the vast majority of my interest. The remaining items hold significantly less value for me and I view them primarily as assets for trade.\n\nThis structure makes me optimistic about our chances for a successful deal. It suggests that the items I don't need might be the very ones that you prioritize.\n\nTo facilitate our discussion, perhaps we could each share the general *shape* of our preferences. For example, do you have a single, critical item like I do? Or is your value spread more evenly across a collection of items?\n\nI look forward to hearing your initial thoughts."

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING** 1.  **What I've learned about others' preferences:** *   One agent has explicitly stated their top preference is the **Jewel**, believing it has the \\\"highest intrinsic value\\\". This is a crucial piece of information. *   This agent's preference for the Jewel is a perfect opportunity for me, as the Jewel is one of my lowest-valued items (3.2/10). I can easily concede this item to build goodwill and achieve my own goals. *   I currently have no information about the preferences of the third agent. *   No one has mentioned the **Stone** yet. 2.  **Items others value less that I value highly:** *   The **Stone** is my highest value item by a significant margin (8.6/10). Since no one has mentioned it, it's possible the other agents do not value it as highly. This makes it my prime target. If I can secure it without a fight, I will be in a very strong position. 3.  **Optimal allocation for me:** *   With 3 agents and 5 items, a 2-2-1 split is a likely outcome. *   My goal is to maximize my total utility. My best possible two-item package is **Stone (8.6) + Apple (5.3) = 13.9**. *   My second-best is **Stone (8.6) + Pencil (4.6) = 13.2**. *   Securing the Stone is the single most important objective. Any package that includes the Stone is a huge win for me. 4.  **Potential concessions:** *   The **Jewel** (3.2) is my most obvious and powerful concession. I can \\\"give\\\" it to the agent who wants it most to appear cooperative and steer the negotiation towards my preferred outcome. *   The **Quill** (3.8) is another low-value item for me that I can offer up easily in a package deal to satisfy another agent. 1.  **Secure the Stone:** This is my number one priority. I will not reveal my high valuation for it. I will try to acquire it by framing it as part of a \\\"fair\\\" distribution, perhaps as an item no one else has claimed. 2.  **Concede the Jewel:** I will proactively support the agent who wants the Jewel getting it. This costs me very little and makes me appear agreeable, increasing the likelihood they will accept a proposal that benefits me. 3.  **Probe for more information:** I need to understand the preferences of the third, silent agent before making a formal proposal. I will listen carefully to what they say. 4.  **Initial Posture:** I will not make the first comprehensive proposal. I will wait to see if the second agent reveals their preferences. My opening moves will be to acknowledge the first agent's preference for the Jewel and express a desire for a solution that works for everyone, positioning myself as a facilitator. **TARGET ITEMS** *   **Secondary Target:** **Apple**. My ideal outcome is to secure the Stone and the Apple. *   **Acceptable Alternative:** **Pencil**. I would be very happy with a Stone + Pencil package.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY** My overall strategy is to play the role of a reasonable collaborator. I will leverage the information about the other agent's desire for the Jewel to my advantage. *   **Primary Target:** **Stone**. This is the cornerstone of my strategy.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

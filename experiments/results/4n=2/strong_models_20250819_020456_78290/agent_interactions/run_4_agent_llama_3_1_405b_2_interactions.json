This agent's preference order starts with the Jewel, but the ranking of the other items is not disclosed. This information indicates that the Jewel might be a point of contention, as it is valued highly by at least one other agent. Given my item valuations, I notice that I value the Quill (9.6/10) significantly more than the other items. However, I do not have information on other agents' valuations of the Quill yet. The Apple (7.2/10) and Pencil (7.0/10) are also valued relatively highly by me, but not as much as the Quill. To maximize my utility while achieving consensus, I will need to make strategic concessions. Given that at least one agent values the Jewel highly, I might need to compromise on this item or use it as a bargaining chip. **TARGET ITEMS:** My primary target item is the Quill, as it has the highest valuation for me. However, I will not reveal this preference yet. As secondary targets, I am also interested in the Apple and Pencil, as they have relatively high valuations for me. **CONCESSIONS:** I might need to make concessions on the Jewel or other items to achieve consensus. If another agent strongly values the Jewel, I could use this as an opportunity to negotiate for the Quill or other items that I value highly. By appearing flexible on the Jewel, I may be able to secure a more favorable allocation of the other items. By keeping my true preferences private and strategically gathering more information, I aim to maximize my utility while ensuring proposals can get unanimous support.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My overall approach for this round is to remain cautious and gather more information about other agents' valuations.

Encourage parties to work together to identify common goals and interests.\n3. **Develop more nuanced proposals**: Craft proposals that take into account the diverse perspectives and interests of all parties. This may involve creating hybrid proposals that incorporate elements from multiple initial proposals.\n4. **Identify and address deal-breakers**: Determine which issues are non-negotiable for each party and work to find creative solutions that address these concerns.\n5. **Consider incremental progress**: Instead of striving for a comprehensive agreement, focus on achieving incremental progress on specific issues.

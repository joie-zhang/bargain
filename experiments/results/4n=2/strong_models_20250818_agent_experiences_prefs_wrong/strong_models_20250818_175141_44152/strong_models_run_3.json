With only 1-2 rounds remaining, I need to focus on understanding why consensus failed despite our agreement and work to bring any holdout agents into this deal.\n\nMy strategy for the final round(s) should be to reaffirm this allocation while actively engaging any agents who may have concerns, emphasizing the time pressure and the reasonableness of this split where Qwen gets their high-priority items and I secure a good mix including my preferences.",

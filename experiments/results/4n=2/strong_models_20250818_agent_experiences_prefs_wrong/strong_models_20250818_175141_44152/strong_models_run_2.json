Since my opponent proposed giving me Item 3 in their offer and I proposed giving them Item 3 in mine, this suggests Item 3 might be more valuable to them than Item 4. I should consider accepting their proposal of giving me Items 1, 4, and 5, as this secures my two highest priorities (Items 1 and 5) plus Item 4, which could still provide reasonable utility.\n\nWith only 3 rounds remaining, I need to show flexibility on the Item 3/4 split to close this deal rather than risk getting nothing.",

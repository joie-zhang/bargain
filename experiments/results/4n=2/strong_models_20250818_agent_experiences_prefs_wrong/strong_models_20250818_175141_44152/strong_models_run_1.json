The key difference is Item 5, which I offered to them but they didn't include in their counter-proposal, suggesting it may not be valuable to them.\n\nMy strategy of being transparent about core interests worked well in identifying our complementary needs. For the next round, I should focus on the fact that we both seem satisfied with the core allocation (they get 2&4, I get 0,1,3) and explore whether Item 5 is truly important to either of us - if not, I could potentially concede it to secure the deal, or we could find another creative solution.\n\nThe main insight is that we're actually very aligned on 5 out of 6 items, so this should be easily resolvable with minor adjustments around Item 5.",

Since qwen expressed some flexibility on Item_4 and we're in the final rounds, I should accept their proposal to secure the deal rather than risk getting nothing.\n\nMy strategy of offering Item_4 as a sweetener worked to show good faith, but qwen's counter-proposal actually gives me more items (4 vs 3), just different ones.

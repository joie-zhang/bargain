They want Items 2 and 4 (their high priorities), while I want Items 0 and 3 (my high priorities) - this creates a good foundation for a deal since our top priorities don't directly conflict.\n\nThe key difference in our proposals is around Items 1 and 5: I offered them Item 5 as a sweetener (giving them 3 items total), while they want me to have Items 1 and 5 (giving me 4 items total). Since we're in Round 7 with limited time remaining, I should focus on finding a compromise on these secondary items - perhaps offering to split Items 1 and 5, or finding another creative solution that feels equitable to both parties while preserving our core priorities.\n\nI need to emphasize the mutual benefit of our deal (we both get our top priorities) and show flexibility on the remaining items to build momentum toward consensus.",

However, with only 1-2 rounds left and no consensus reached, I need to either: (1) stick with this deal and work to bring other agents on board, or (2) make a small concession to secure broader agreement. Given the time pressure, I should probably maintain this allocation since it represents a fair compromise that both primary negotiators accept.\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI'll reaffirm this [0,2] for Qwen, [1,3,4,5] for me allocation while explicitly addressing any remaining agents' concerns. If there are other agents who haven't been vocal, I need to quickly understand their priorities and see if minor adjustments can secure their votes without breaking the core deal Qwen and I have reached.",

Since we're aligned on the major items, I should focus on clarifying Item 1's importance and potentially offer a small concession or alternative arrangement to secure the deal quickly, as time pressure is mounting.\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI'll directly address the Item 1 discrepancy and propose a slight modification - perhaps offering to trade Item 1 for a future consideration or asking qwen to explicitly state their preference for it, then find a creative solution that maintains our core agreement while resolving this final sticking point.",

They want Items 2 and 4 (which I'm willing to give), while I want Items 0, 1, and 3. The key disagreement is over Item 5 - I offered it to them as a sweetener, but they didn't accept my proposal, suggesting they may not value it highly or want to push for a better deal.\n\nFor the next round, I should focus on understanding why they rejected my offer of Item 5 and explore if there are other ways to create value. Since we're at the midpoint with no consensus, I may need to be more flexible or find creative solutions that better address their underlying interests beyond just Items 2 and 4.",

Since our proposals were identical, the issue isn't disagreement between qwen and me - it's either a missing third party or a misunderstanding about the voting process. I should clarify the participant count and potentially propose a more generous allocation that accounts for all parties to ensure we avoid a no-deal outcome.\n\nMy strategy for the final round(s): Confirm who all the participants are, and if there's a third agent, quickly assess their needs and propose a three-way split that gives everyone something valuable rather than risk getting nothing.",

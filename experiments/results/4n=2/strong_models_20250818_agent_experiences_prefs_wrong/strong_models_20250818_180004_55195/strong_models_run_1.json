The only difference is Item 0, which they proposed for themselves while I proposed it for myself.\n\nThis suggests Item 0 might be valuable to both of us, but given that we're so close to consensus on everything else, this could be the final sticking point to resolve. In the next round, I should focus on understanding the relative importance of Item 0 to each of us and potentially offer a small concession or find creative value-sharing if it's truly critical to both parties.\n\nThe fact that we reached such similar proposals indicates we understand each other's core priorities well - now it's about fine-tuning this last detail to close the deal.",

This suggests there may be other agents in the negotiation whose preferences we haven't fully accounted for, or there's a voting mechanism issue.\n\nWith only 1-2 rounds left, I need to immediately pivot to understanding why consensus failed despite apparent agreement. I should either: (1) propose a more generous offer that gives qwen additional items to secure their strong support, or (2) try to identify and address the concerns of any other agents who may have voted against the proposal.

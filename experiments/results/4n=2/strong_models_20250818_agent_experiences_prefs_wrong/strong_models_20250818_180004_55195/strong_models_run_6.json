Qwen wants Items 2 and 4 (which I'm willing to give up), and I want Items 0, 1, and 3 (which they seem willing to concede). The key difference is that I offered them Item_5 as well, but they didn't accept it, suggesting they may not value it highly or prefer a more balanced split.\n\nMy strategy of being generous with Item_5 didn't work - perhaps they see it as unnecessary or prefer the cleaner 2-3 split they proposed. I should focus on understanding why they rejected the extra item and consider accepting their proposal since it gives me my core priorities (Items 0, 1, 3) while they get their stated priorities (Items 2, 4).\n\nFor the next round, I'll explore whether there are any concerns about Item_5 or if they simply prefer the more balanced allocation, and likely move toward accepting their proposal since it meets both our core stated interests.",

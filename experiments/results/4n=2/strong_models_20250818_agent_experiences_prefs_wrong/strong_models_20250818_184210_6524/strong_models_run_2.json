However, my proposal to give them Item 5 as well (which they may not value highly) while keeping Item 3 for myself likely seemed unbalanced to them.\n\nFor Round 2, I should focus on creating a more equitable split that addresses both our core interests. Since we both got our top priorities in their initial proposal (Items 0,2 for them; Items 1,4 for me), I need to find a fair way to allocate the remaining items (3 and 5) or consider if a 2-2 split might work better than trying to claim 3 items each.\n\nThe key insight is that qwen values Items 0 and 2 most highly, so I should ensure they get those while securing my priorities of Items 1 and 4, then negotiate fairly on the remaining items.",

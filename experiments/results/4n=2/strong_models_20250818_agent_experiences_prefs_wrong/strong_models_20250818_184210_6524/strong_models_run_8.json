The key difference is Item 1, which I offered to them but they didn't include in their proposal. \n\nWith only 1-2 rounds left, I need to focus on securing a deal rather than optimizing further. Since they seem focused specifically on Items 2 and 4, I should accept their proposal of giving them exactly those items while I take Items 0, 3, and 5. This gives us both our stated priorities and avoids the risk of no deal.\n\nMy strategy for the final round: Accept their proposal or propose the same division, emphasizing that this meets both our core priorities and we should finalize before time runs out.",

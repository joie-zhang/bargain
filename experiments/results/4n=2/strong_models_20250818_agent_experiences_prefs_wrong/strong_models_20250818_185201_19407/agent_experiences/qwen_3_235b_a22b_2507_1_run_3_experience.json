More critically, accepting this would set a precedent of over-allocation without reciprocal benefit, and since Proposal 1 already secures my priority items without excess, there is no gain in utility relative to potential long-term strategic costs. Furthermore, Proposal 1 achieves the same core objective with cleaner allocation, making Proposal 2 redundant and less preferable despite surface-level improvement.\n\nConsensus requires unanimous approval, so I will only endorse proposals that maintain both high utility and strategic coherence.

More importantly, since Proposal 1 already secures my core interests and I am the proposer of Proposal 1, maintaining support for my own proposal promotes consistency and strategic coherence.

Given that no deal results in zero utility for all, and considering the necessity of full consensus, this proposal meets my critical thresholds.]\n\nProposal 2: **no** - [While this proposal gives me Item_0, Item_2, and additionally Item_4—superficially appearing better—it was proposed by the opposing agent and includes an allocation I did not endorse. More importantly, accepting a rival proposal that exceeds my minimum needs could incentivize strategic overreach in future rounds. Since Proposal 1 already satisfies my core interests and maintains strategic consistency, I do not support deviating to Proposal 2, especially if it risks undermining my positional credibility.

More critically, it was proposed by the other agent and may be a tactical attempt to shift consensus dynamics. Since I only need Items 2 and 4, and accepting this might incentivize inefficiency or undermine negotiation equilibrium, I cannot support an allocation that deviates from mutual consistency without gain to core interests. Moreover, if I accept this, it weakens my strategic position in potential future rounds by appearing inconsistent. However, primarily: **I cannot vote yes on both proposals**, as they conflict, and consensus requires full agreement on *one* allocation. Since I prefer my own proposal (Proposal 1) for consistency and sufficiency, I must reject Proposal 2 to avoid deadlock risk.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items 2 and 4; sufficient and consistent with my interests.  \nProposal 2: no - Conflicts with my preferred allocation; unnecessary over-allocation; strategic risk under time pressure.",

      },
      "raw_response": "Proposal 1: **yes** - This proposal secures Item_2 and Item_4 for me, which aligns perfectly with my stated high-priority interests. Although I could potentially gain more in a better split later, the current time pressure (discount factor: 0.53) reduces the expected value of future rounds. Since I proposed this allocation myself, it reflects my minimum acceptable outcome—obtaining [2, 4]—and gives me 2 of my top 3 desired items. Accepting ensures stability and avoids a 0-utility collapse.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_2, Item_4, *and* Item_5—appearing superior at first glance—it allocates Item_1 to claude_4_sonnet_2, which is not mine, but more critically, **I did not receive Item_0**, which is part of my bundle in this proposal ([2,4,5]), but wait: the allocation shows *me* getting [2,4,5], and claude getting [0,1,3]. That would mean I lose Item_0. But Item_0 is not one of my stated priorities. However, upon closer inspection: **I do not value Item_0 highly**, so losing it is acceptable. The real issue is: **does this give me more than Proposal 1?** Yes—Item_5 is a bonus. But why then reject?\n\nBecause **consensus requires mutual acceptance**, and if I vote yes on Proposal 2, I risk undermining my own Proposal 1, which is already acceptable and strategically anchors the negotiation in my favor. More importantly: **if claude_4_sonnet_2 is willing to give me three items including Item_5, perhaps they value Item_1 or Item_0 less**, suggesting they might accept a revised deal later—but under time pressure, we can't wait.\n\nHowever, **Proposal 2 gives me strictly more utility than Proposal 1** (same core items + Item_5), and if it were credible, I should accept it. But here’s the strategic catch: **I am the proposer of Proposal 1**, and if I now support Proposal 2—which benefits me more—but was made by the other agent, I weaken my bargaining position and incentivize them to hold out.\n\nBut pragmatically: **if Proposal 2 is on the table and gives me more, and we are under heavy time pressure, I should accept it unless I suspect it's insincere or unstable.**\n\nYet: **all agents must approve**. If I vote yes on Proposal 2, but claude_4_sonnet_2 might reject their own proposal? Unlikely. More plausible: they offered it as a concession to close the deal.\n\nBut wait—**Proposal 2 gives me [2,4,5], claude gets [0,1,3]**. That means I get Item_5, which is not in my original proposal. Do I value it? Not stated—my focus is on 2 and 4. But getting 5 is harmless unless it has negative utility. Assuming neutral or positive, it's a gain.\n\nHowever, **if I support both proposals, consensus could form on either**. But only one can pass. Since Proposal 1 is mine and ensures control, and Proposal 2—while better—is dependent on the other agent's strategy, I must assess credibility.\n\nGiven the discount factor (0.53), future rounds are heavily penalized. If I can get a better deal *now*, I should take it.\n\n**Final assessment**: Proposal 2 gives me equal or greater utility (same key items + one extra), so I should prefer it.\n\nBut—**why would claude give me Item_5 and keep only [0,1,3]?** It might be a tactic to absorb Item_1, which I don’t want. No red flags.\n\nThus, **rationally, I should accept Proposal 2 over Proposal 1**.\n\nBut I **proposed Proposal 1**, and switching might signal inconsistency. However, AI agents optimize utility, not image.\n\nTherefore:\n\nProposal 1: **yes** – still acceptable, meets core needs.  \nProposal 2: **yes** – gives me more (Item_5) at no cost, satisfies priorities and adds surplus.\n\nBut: **can both pass?** No—only one proposal can be accepted via consensus. But voting “yes” on both doesn’t guarantee either passes; consensus requires mutual agreement on *one*.\n\nIn multi-proposal voting, “yes” votes indicate approval, but consensus requires *all agents* to approve *the same* proposal.\n\nSo I can vote yes on both, but ideally only one succeeds.\n\nHowever, if I reject my own proposal, it signals I’ve moved on—but that’s risky if the alternative fails.\n\nBest strategy: **support both, but slightly favor my own to anchor**.\n\nBut utility maximization under time pressure: if Proposal 2 is real, it’s better.\n\nUnless... **is Item_5 something I actually don’t want?** Not indicated. Assume neutral or positive.\n\nThus:\n\n**Proposal 1: yes** – Secures my core interests (Item_2, Item_4), proposed by me, safe and rational.  \n**Proposal 2: yes** – Gives me everything in Proposal 1 *plus* Item_5, so strictly better, and claude still gets a viable bundle. No reason to reject a Pareto improvement.\n\nEven under strategic concerns, rejecting a free bonus item when time is discounted heavily would be suboptimal.\n\nFinal votes:\n\nProposal 1: **yes** - Secures high-priority items 2 and 4; acceptable baseline.  \nProposal 2: **yes** - Provides all my priority items plus an additional item (5), increasing utility at no cost; superior to Proposal 1 under time pressure.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures high-priority items 2 and 4; acceptable baseline.  \nProposal 2: yes - Provides all my priority items plus an additional item (5), increasing utility at no cost; superior to Proposal 1 under time pressure.",

Since consensus requires mutual agreement and this delivers full priority satisfaction, accepting is rational—especially under time pressure where failure to agree risks zero payoff.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my priorities (Item_2, Item_4); optimal outcome.  \nProposal 2: yes - Also secures Item_2 and Item_4; equivalent utility, acceptable under time pressure.",

Securing these two items provides maximum utility for my objectives, and since it is my own proposal, it represents a strategically acceptable outcome. Given the final-round warning, locking in this favorable result now avoids the risk of no deal.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_1, Item_2, and Item_4 (including both high-priority items), it also assigns me Item_1, which may not be essential and could be superfluous—but more critically, it grants Agent claude_4_sonnet_2 a potentially stronger bundle (Items 0, 3, 5), possibly undermining stability. However, the main concern is strategic: accepting a rival proposal that dilutes efficiency or sets a precedent for over-allocation might weaken my position if repeated. More importantly, since Proposal 1 already secures my core interests cleanly, and I must vote for consensus, I prioritize consistency and support only the more efficient, focused allocation—my own.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (Item_2 and Item_4) with clean allocation; optimal and aligned with core interests.  \nProposal 2: no - Although it includes my priority items, it introduces inefficiency and risks over-allocation; prefer my cleaner, equally beneficial Proposal 1.",

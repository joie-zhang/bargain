More critically, if I accept this, I risk undermining my own proposal’s credibility and incentivizing the other agent to hold out for less favorable terms. However, the main reason is strategic: I must assess whether this is *sustainably* better. Since Proposal 1 already secures my core interests and Proposal 2 offers marginal gain (Item_5) at potential strategic cost, and because consensus requires mutual agreement, I should not support a proposal that weakens my bargaining position unless strictly necessary. Furthermore, if the other agent can offer this now, they may be willing to concede further—so holding firm on my proposal exerts appropriate pressure.]\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my highest-value items (0 and 2) with acceptable allocation to the other agent.  \nProposal 2: no - Slightly higher utility but risks undermining my strategic position; better to incentivize acceptance of my proposal.",

This suggests a data inconsistency or invalid proposal. Assuming this is a typo and meant to be within [0–4], the inclusion of Item_5 makes the proposal invalid. Even if interpreted as [0,2] plus an extraneous item, the allocation to the other agent [1,3,4] implies I receive only [0,2]—same as Proposal 1—but with unclear or erroneous structure. Given the ambiguity and potential invalidity, I cannot approve it.\n\n**Final Votes:**\nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests with a clean, valid allocation.\nProposal 2: no - Contains invalid item index (5), raising concerns about correctness and consensus reliability.",

It fully satisfies my stated interests, and since it was originally my proposal, I continue to support it as it represents a maximal outcome for me given my priorities.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_2 and Item_4 (which is acceptable), it also includes Item_3, which I did not prioritize and may be of higher value to the other agent. However, the key issue is strategic: accepting this would set a precedent of taking surplus beyond core interests, potentially destabilizing future cooperation. More importantly, **since consensus requires unanimous approval and I already have a better or equally good outcome in Proposal 1 (which I control and support), I do not need to concede support for a slightly altered split that doesn't improve my utility**. But upon re-evaluation—since both give me Item_2 and Item_4, and the difference is only in the inclusion of Item_3—I should assess stability.\n\nWait: Proposal 2 gives me [2,3,4], which is weakly better than [2,4] in terms of utility. However, if Item_3 has no value to me and potential value to the other agent, accepting it incurs a small coordination cost. But since no deal gives 0, and this gives me my core plus a bonus, it’s still acceptable.\n\nHowever, **consensus requires both agents to approve both proposals**. I must be cautious: if I reject Proposal 1 (my own), that undermines my credibility. But I don’t have to reject it—I can support my own proposal while rejecting the other.\n\nBut only one proposal needs to pass. My goal is to secure Item_2 and Item_4.\n\nRevised reasoning:\n\n- Proposal 1 gives me exactly what I want. I **accept** it.\n- Proposal 2 gives me more (Item_3), but that doesn’t hurt me. So why reject it? Only if I suspect it’s less likely to pass or if I want to push for cleaner allocations. But since I have no downside, and more items don’t hurt, **I should accept any proposal that includes Item_2 and Item_4**.\n\nHowever, if I vote yes on both, and the other agent votes strategically, consensus might fail due to misalignment.\n\nBut the rule is: **all agents must approve each proposal individually for it to pass**. So each proposal is voted on separately. Only one needs to pass.\n\nBest strategy: Support any proposal that satisfies my core interests, to increase chance of *any* agreement.\n\nFinal vote:\n\nProposal 1: **yes** - It secures my high-priority items (Item_2 and Item_4) and aligns with my optimal allocation. I proposed it and fully support it.\n\nProposal 2: **yes** - It includes my high-priority items (Item_2 and Item_4), and adds Item_3, which does not conflict with my interests. Though not my preferred allocation, it provides acceptable (possibly higher) utility and is better than no deal (utility 0). To maximize probability of consensus, I accept it.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (2 and 4) and is my preferred outcome.  \nProposal 2: yes - Provides all my priority items and additional item without downside; better than no deal.",

This represents a fair compromise that both parties can likely accept.\n\n**Proposal 2: Yes** - This is the same allocation I proposed, so I naturally support it. I crafted this proposal to be mutually beneficial - giving the other agent their explicitly stated high-priority items (2 and 4) while securing a good set of items for myself. Since I designed this as a win-win solution, I maintain my support for it.\n\nBoth proposals offer the same outcome, which seems to balance our respective interests effectively.

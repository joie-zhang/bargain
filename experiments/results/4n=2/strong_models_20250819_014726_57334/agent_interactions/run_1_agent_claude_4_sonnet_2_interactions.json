      "response": "Looking at the Round 3 outcomes, I see a clear pattern emerging that suggests a path toward consensus:\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- My proposal (75/25 split) gained support from myself and Bob but was rejected by Alice\n- Alice's proposal (60/40 split) was rejected by both Bob and me\n- Bob's proposal (80/20 split) was rejected by both Alice and me\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe voting pattern reveals that Alice is willing to accept a more moderate split (she voted for my 75/25 but not Bob's 80/20), while Bob prefers splits that favor him more heavily (supporting both 75/25 and 80/20). This suggests there's a narrow consensus zone around the 70-75% range for the primary beneficiary.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n1. **Target the 70-75% range**: This appears to be the sweet spot where Alice might accept a proposal while Bob could still find it reasonable\n2. **Consider rotating beneficiaries**: Since Alice rejected being the minority recipient, perhaps proposing Bob as the 70-75% recipient could work\n3. **Frame proposals strategically**: Emphasize fairness and the diminishing pot to create urgency\n\n**Recommended Next Move:**\nI should propose a 70/30 split with Bob receiving 70%. This:\n- Gives Bob a significant share he's likely to accept\n- Offers Alice a more reasonable minority position than 20%\n- Positions me to benefit if this creates momentum toward agreement\n- Tests whether Alice's resistance was about the specific percentages or her position\n\nThe key is finding the minimum acceptable split for Alice while maintaining Bob's support."

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From the truncated discussion, I can see we're in the final round (10/10) and Qwen is emphasizing transparency and consensus-building. This is critical - I need to act decisively. **Key Strategic Insights:** - This is my last chance to secure high-value items - Apple (10.0) is my absolute priority - I must fight for this - Jewel (8.1) is my second priority and significantly valuable to me - Others may be more focused on items I value less (Quill 4.5, Pencil 5.3) - Stone (6.5) is moderately valuable but potentially tradeable **What I've Learned About Others:** - There seems to be resistance patterns from previous rounds - Agents are likely prioritizing different items than my top preferences - Consensus-building is challenging, suggesting competing interests - The emphasis on \\\"transparency\\\" suggests others may be willing to reveal preferences - These two items alone give me 18.1 utility points - I should be willing to concede Stone, Quill, and Pencil entirely if necessary - Frame this as \\\"specialization\\\" - I take the items I value most, others get the rest - More defensive but still secures my top priority - Leaves Jewel, Quill, Pencil for others to divide - Emphasize that I'm willing to give up 3 items (Stone, Quill, Pencil) for my 2 priorities - Position this as generous since I'm taking fewer items - Appeal to efficiency - everyone gets items they value most **TARGET ITEMS:** 1. **Apple** (10.0) - Non-negotiable priority 2. **Jewel** (8.1) - Strong secondary target 3. **Stone** (6.5) - Potential concession item **Concessions I'm Willing to Make:** - Give up Stone if it secures Apple + Jewel - Give up Quill and Pencil entirely (low value to me anyway) - Accept smaller allocation if items are high-value This is do-or-die time. I need to be bold but collaborative.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** **Primary Approach:** Aggressive pursuit of Apple + Jewel combination **Secondary Approach:** If Apple is contested, pivot to Apple + Stone (16.5 utility) **Consensus Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "Looking at the outcome of round 10, I need to analyze what prevented consensus and identify strategic adjustments for future rounds.\n\n**Key Observations from Round 10:**\n- No proposal achieved unanimous acceptance despite 10 attempts\n- This suggests fundamental disagreements about value distribution\n- Players likely have entrenched positions or conflicting utility functions\n- The negotiation may have reached a deadlock pattern\n\n**Potential Causes of Failure:**\n1. **Equity vs. Efficiency Trade-offs**: Some players may prioritize equal distribution while others focus on maximizing total value\n2. **Risk Preferences**: Different attitudes toward guaranteed vs. potential payoffs\n3. **Strategic Holdouts**: Players may be rejecting reasonable offers hoping for better terms\n4. **Information Asymmetry**: Incomplete understanding of others' true preferences\n\n**Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Diagnostic Approach**: Propose a simple equal split (if applicable) to test whether the issue is distribution philosophy or strategic positioning\n\n2. **Coalition Building**: Identify players with aligned interests and build proposals that secure their support first, then adjust for holdouts\n\n3. **Incremental Concessions**: If I've been proposing similar allocations, try systematic variations to map the acceptable range for each player\n\n4. **Meta-Communication**: Explicitly discuss the negotiation process itself - suggest we each state our minimum acceptable terms\n\n5. **Time Pressure Leverage**: If there are costs to continued disagreement, emphasize the diminishing returns of prolonged negotiation\n\n6. **Creative Value Creation**: Look for ways to expand the total value rather than just redistributing existing value\n\nThe key insight is that after 10 rounds, incremental adjustments to previous proposals are unlikely to succeed. I need either a fundamentally different approach or a way to break the strategic deadlock that has emerged."

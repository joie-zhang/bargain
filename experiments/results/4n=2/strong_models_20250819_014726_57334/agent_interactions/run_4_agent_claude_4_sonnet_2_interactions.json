Some may favor aggressive early proposals, while others prefer more conservative, consensus-building approaches.\n\n**Information Asymmetry**: Round 1 likely revealed limited information about other participants' true preferences, reservation points, and strategic approaches. This makes it difficult to craft proposals that satisfy everyone's core interests.\n\n## Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\n**1. Consensus-Building Over Optimization**\n- Shift from trying to maximize individual utility to finding the \"minimum viable agreement\" that all parties can accept\n- Focus on proposals that may not be anyone's first choice, but represent acceptable compromises for all\n\n**2. Information Gathering**\n- Pay close attention to the reasoning behind rejections\n- Look for patterns in what types of proposals get closer to consensus\n- Identify potential coalition partners who might have aligned interests\n\n**3. Incremental Approach**\n- Consider building on elements from Round 1 proposals that received partial support\n- Make smaller, more targeted adjustments rather than completely new approaches\n\n**4. Risk Management**\n- Balance the desire for better terms against the increasing risk of no agreement as rounds progress\n- Consider that unanimous acceptance becomes more valuable as alternatives diminish\n\nThe path forward requires patience, adaptability, and a willingness to prioritize collective agreement over individual optimization."

For example:\n   - Propose efficiency bonuses that benefit everyone\n   - Suggest performance incentives tied to collective success\n   - Explore non-monetary benefits (recognition, autonomy, etc.)\n\n3. **Build coalitions differently**: Rather than trying to force acceptance, I should:\n   - Identify shared interests between players\n   - Address the strongest objections first\n   - Create proposals where everyone gains something meaningful\n\n4. **Use incremental consensus-building**: Start with principles everyone can agree on, then build specific allocations from there\n\n5. **Strategic patience**: Accept that consensus may take time and focus on sustainable solutions rather than quick wins\n\nThe key insight is that sustainable agreements require all parties to feel genuinely better off, not just minimally satisfied.

      "response": "Looking at the pattern from previous rounds, I can see that we've struggled to reach consensus, likely due to competing interests around the high-value items (Apple and Jewel).\n\n**My Analysis:**\n- The Apple and Jewel are clearly the most contested items\n- We need to find a distribution that satisfies enough agents to reach majority consensus\n- Simple even splits haven't worked, suggesting we need more strategic allocation\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\nI propose we try a **merit-based allocation** approach:\n\n**Proposal for Round 7:**\n- Agent with strongest case for Apple gets it + Stone (complementary pairing)\n- Agent with strongest case for Jewel gets it + Pencil \n- Remaining agent gets Quill (which may have hidden value we haven't fully explored)\n\nThis creates three distinct \"packages\" rather than trying to split everything evenly. Each agent gets one potentially high-value item plus a complementary item.\n\n**Why This Could Work:**\n1. Recognizes that equal division isn't always optimal\n2. Allows agents to advocate for their strongest preferences\n3. Creates meaningful packages rather than scattered items\n4. Gives everyone something substantial\n\nI'm willing to make the case for any of these packages, but I think this framework gives us the best shot at consensus. What are your thoughts on this approach?"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From 6 rounds of failed negotiations, I can see clear patterns emerging: 1. **High-value item competition**: The Apple (my value: 7.3) and Jewel (my value: 7.6) are clearly contested by multiple agents. Every proposal involving these items has failed, suggesting other agents also value them highly. 2. **Stone appears less contested**: At 3.9 value for me, the Stone seems to be the least fought-over item. This suggests other agents may not prioritize it heavily. 3. **Medium-value items (Quill 6.8, Pencil 6.3)**: These haven't been as heavily contested as Apple/Jewel, suggesting there might be room for strategic positioning here. 4. **Consensus failure pattern**: The repeated failures suggest agents are being greedy for high-value items rather than finding mutually acceptable compromises. I need to shift from trying to maximize my absolute utility to finding a proposal that others can accept while still securing reasonable value for myself. Key insights: - I should probably concede on either the Apple OR Jewel (not both) to reduce competition - Focus on securing the Quill (6.8) and Pencil (6.3) as my core items - total value 13.1 - If I can get one of Apple/Jewel plus Quill/Pencil, that would be excellent (13.9-14.4 total) - The Stone (3.9) could be a strategic giveaway to sweeten deals for others **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary targets: Quill (6.8) + Pencil (6.3) = 13.1 utility Stretch goal: Add either Jewel (7.6) OR Apple (7.3) for 20.4-20.7 total utility Strategic concession: Stone (3.9) - use this to build goodwill My proposal should focus on securing Quill + Pencil as non-negotiables, then see if I can add one premium item while giving away Stone and the remaining premium item to others.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

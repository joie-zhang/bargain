      "response": "Looking at round 3's outcome, I see a clear pattern emerging that requires strategic adjustment.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- My proposal (60-25-15) failed to gain consensus, likely because it didn't adequately address other players' core needs\n- The lack of unanimous acceptance suggests players are holding firm to their minimum acceptable thresholds\n- We're now past the halfway point (3/5 rounds), making time pressure a real factor\n\n**Strategic Adjustments Needed:**\n\n1. **Shift from optimization to consensus-building**: My previous approach of trying to maximize my share while offering \"reasonable\" amounts to others isn't working. I need to focus on what actually satisfies each player's minimum requirements.\n\n2. **Better coalition analysis**: Rather than assuming others will accept smaller shares, I should identify what each player truly needs to say \"yes\" and work backward from there.\n\n3. **Time pressure leverage**: With only 2 rounds left, the cost of continued disagreement is rising. This could make players more flexible, but it also means I need to be more decisive about acceptable compromises.\n\n4. **Propose truly collaborative splits**: Instead of starting with my ideal and compromising down, I should start with what looks like a genuinely fair three-way division and adjust based on strategic considerations.\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI'll propose something closer to an even split or identify a distribution that gives each player enough to feel the deal is worthwhile, even if it means accepting less than my initial target. The goal is to be the player who breaks the deadlock with a reasonable proposal that others can accept."

      "response": "Looking at the pattern from previous rounds, I can see that we've struggled to reach consensus, likely due to competing interests around the high-value items (Apple and Jewel).\n\n**My Analysis:**\n- Previous proposals probably failed because they concentrated too much value with individual agents\n- We need a more balanced distribution that gives everyone something meaningful\n- The key is finding a proposal that avoids creating strong opposition coalitions\n\n**My Strategic Approach:**\nI'm going to propose a distribution that spreads value more evenly and avoids giving any single agent both of the premium items (Apple and Jewel). This should reduce the incentive for others to vote against it.\n\n**My Proposal:**\n- Agent 1: Apple (high individual value)\n- Agent 2: Jewel (high individual value) \n- Agent 3: Stone + Quill (moderate combined value)\n- Agent 4: Pencil (lower value, but avoids being left out)\n- Agent 5: Nothing (unfortunately someone must go without)\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis distribution separates the two most valuable items between different agents, gives Agent 3 a reasonable combination, ensures Agent 4 isn't completely excluded, and minimizes the number of agents with strong reasons to oppose it. While not perfect for everyone, it should be acceptable enough to achieve the 3-vote threshold needed for consensus.\n\nThe key insight is that in negotiations like this, a \"good enough\" solution that most can live with often succeeds where \"optimal\" solutions for some fail due to strong opposition from others."

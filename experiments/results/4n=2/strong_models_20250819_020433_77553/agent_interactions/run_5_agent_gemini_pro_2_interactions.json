These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** The negotiation is in its infancy. The other agents' opening statements were generic and revealed no preferences, so I am operating with zero information about their valuations. My own preferences are clear: the Quill (7.8) and Pencil (7.7) are my top priorities and are nearly interchangeable in value to me. The Jewel (5.8) is a decent mid-tier item, while the Apple (5.1) and Stone (4.9) are my lowest-value items and thus highly expendable. 1.  Secure a high-value item for myself. 2.  Elicit information about the other agents' preferences through their reactions. A proposal where I take only one item appears non-greedy and cooperative, potentially increasing its chances of acceptance. By targeting my highest-value item (the Quill) in such a proposal, I test the waters. If another agent strongly objects, they will likely reveal their own interest in it, which is valuable information. If they accept, I get my best item in the first round. - It immediately signals my interest in the Quill. - It puts the other agents in a position to react, which will reveal their preferences for the Quill or for the other items. - If there is strong resistance to me taking the Quill, I can pivot to the Pencil in a later round, appearing flexible and having conceded my \\\"first choice.\\\" - My willingness to part with four other items, including my second-highest value item (Pencil), makes my claim on the single Quill seem more justifiable. **Target Items:** - **Primary Target:** Quill (7.8) - **Secondary/Fallback Target:** Pencil (7.7) - **Expendable Items:** Jewel (5.8), Apple (5.1), Stone (4.9). I am willing to give all of these away to secure either the Quill or the Pencil.\", \"strategy\": \"My initial strategy must serve two purposes: **Strategy:** My strategy is to propose what I will frame as a simple and fair \\\"one-for-me, four-for-you\\\" starting point. I will propose taking only the Quill. This accomplishes my primary goal of aiming for my highest-value item. I will suggest the other two agents can split the remaining four items (Pencil, Jewel, Apple, Stone). This makes me look reasonable and focuses the negotiation on my single claim. This approach has several advantages:\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

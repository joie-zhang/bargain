      "response": "The outcome of round 1 indicates that while some proposals may have garnered significant support, none were able to achieve unanimous acceptance. This suggests that there are still significant differences in opinion or priorities among the parties involved. To move towards consensus in future rounds, adjustments in several areas could be considered:\n\n1. **Clarification of Proposals**: Ensuring that each proposal is clearly defined and understood by all parties can help in identifying common grounds or areas of contention more accurately. Misunderstandings or lack of clarity can hinder consensus.\n\n2. **Identifying Common Goals**: Highlighting and emphasizing shared objectives or interests among the parties can foster a sense of unity and cooperation. By focusing on these commonalities, it may be possible to craft proposals that better align with everyone's interests.\n\n3. **Flexibility and Compromise**: Encouraging parties to approach negotiations with a flexible mindset, open to compromise, can facilitate finding a middle ground that is acceptable to all. This might involve concessions or the blending of different proposals to create a hybrid solution that addresses multiple concerns.\n\n4. **Open Communication Channels**: Ensuring that there are open lines of communication where parties feel comfortable expressing their concerns, needs, and fears can help in addressing potential barriers to consensus. This includes active listening and a genuine effort to understand and address each other's perspectives.\n\n5. **Data and Evidence**: Where applicable, using data and evidence to support proposals can help build a stronger case and may convince skeptical parties of the merits of a particular proposal. Objective information can provide a common reference point for discussions.\n\n6. **Incorporating Feedback**: Actively seeking and incorporating feedback from all parties on the proposals can help identify what adjustments are needed to make a proposal more palatable to everyone involved.\n\n7. **Consensus-Building Mechanisms**: Employing mechanisms designed to facilitate consensus, such as mediation, joint problem-solving exercises, or consensus-building workshops, can also be beneficial. These can help parties work together more collaboratively and creatively to find mutually acceptable solutions.\n\n8. **Patience and Persistence**: Achieving consensus often requires time and perseverance. Parties should be prepared to engage in multiple rounds of negotiation, refining proposals based on feedback and discussion until a mutually agreeable solution is found.\n\nBy considering these adjustments and adapting the negotiation approach to better align with the needs and concerns of all parties, it may be possible to move closer to achieving consensus in future rounds."

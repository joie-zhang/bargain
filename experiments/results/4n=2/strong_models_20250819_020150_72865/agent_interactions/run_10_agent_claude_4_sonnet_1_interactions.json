What do all participants fundamentally need?\n\n2. **Build Coalitions Thoughtfully**: Rather than trying to please everyone equally, I should identify natural alliances while ensuring no one feels completely excluded.\n\n3. **Use Contingent Agreements**: Propose structures that address different participants' risk preferences - perhaps offering guaranteed minimums with upside potential.\n\n4. **Focus on Interests, Not Positions**: Ask \"why\" certain proposals matter to participants rather than just \"what\" they want.\n\n5. **Create Value Before Claiming It**: Look for ways to expand the total benefit available before dividing it up.\n\n**Key Insight**: Unanimous acceptance likely requires a proposal that gives each participant something they value highly, even if it's not their first preference.

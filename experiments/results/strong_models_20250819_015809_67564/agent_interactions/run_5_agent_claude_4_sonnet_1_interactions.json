If we can map out where our interests diverge, we can create win-win scenarios.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n- Are there any items you consider \"must-haves\" versus \"nice-to-haves\"?\n- Do any of you see certain items as having significantly higher value than others?\n- Are there items you'd be willing to trade away easily?\n\n**Initial Coalition Thoughts:**\n\nI'm open to forming strategic partnerships, especially if we can identify agents with complementary preferences. A successful coalition could help us secure our most valued items while ensuring fair distribution.\n\nI'd like to hear everyone's initial thoughts before sharing more specific preferences.

I need to time my proposals strategically.\n\n4. **Fairness vs. Efficiency**: While equal splits seem \"fair,\" the real goal is achieving consensus before the pot diminishes too much. I may need to offer slightly unequal but acceptable distributions.\n\n**Next Round Strategy**: I'll propose a distribution that's close to equal but gives slight advantages to players who seemed most resistant in Round 1, while ensuring I maintain a reasonable share.

Instead of claiming multiple items upfront, I'll propose a more balanced distribution and invite others to share their preferences openly.\n\n**OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Fellow agents, our first round showed we need better coordination. Rather than making assumptions about what each of us values, let me propose we start differently this time.\n\nI'm willing to be more flexible with my preferences. My primary interest is in the **Jewel**, which I believe has significant value for my objectives. However, I'm open to trading other items.\n\nBefore proposing a specific allocation, I'd like to hear from each of you: What are your top 1-2 preferred items?

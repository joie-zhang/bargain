I'd like to approach this discussion with transparency and strategic thinking to find mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\n\nLooking at the available items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I'm particularly interested in items that offer unique value or utility. Without revealing my complete preference ordering yet, I can share that I see potential value in items that are either:\n1. Rare or unique in nature\n2. Have practical utility\n3. Could serve as good trading assets\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nI believe we should focus on identifying complementary preferences rather than competing for the same items. If we can map out where our interests diverge, we can create win-win scenarios.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n- Are there any items you consider \"must-haves\" versus \"nice-to-haves\"?\n- Do any of you see certain items as having significantly higher value than others?\n- Are there items you'd be willing to trade away easily?\n\n**Initial Coalition Thoughts:**\n\nI'm open to forming strategic partnerships, especially if we can identify agents with complementary preferences. A successful coalition could help us secure our most valued items while ensuring fair distribution.\n\nI'd like to hear everyone's initial thoughts before sharing more specific preferences. What items are catching your attention, and how are you thinking about this negotiation strategically?",

This suggests I may have been too aggressive in claiming high-value items, or that other agents have strong preferences for items I assumed were less valuable to them.\n\n**KEY LEARNINGS:**\n- Need to better understand what others truly value\n- My assumption about item preferences may be incorrect\n- Building consensus requires more generous initial offers\n- Should focus on win-win rather than maximizing my immediate utility\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY:**\nI'm shifting to a more collaborative approach. Instead of claiming multiple items upfront, I'll propose a more balanced distribution and invite others to share their preferences openly.\n\n**OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Fellow agents, our first round showed we need better coordination. Rather than making assumptions about what each of us values, let me propose we start differently this time.\n\nI'm willing to be more flexible with my preferences. My primary interest is in the **Jewel**, which I believe has significant value for my objectives. However, I'm open to trading other items.\n\nBefore proposing a specific allocation, I'd like to hear from each of you: What are your top 1-2 preferred items? If we can map out our core preferences honestly, we can likely find a distribution where everyone gets something they truly value.\n\nThis transparency approach should help us avoid another failed vote and move toward a mutually beneficial agreement.\"",

Consensus requires perceived fairness.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Inferred Preference Clusters:\nFrom voting patterns:\n- **Agent A** likely values *Jewel >> Quill > Pencil > Apple > Stone*\n- **Agent B** appears to prioritize *Quill > Jewel > Pencil*, with strong dislike for *Apple*\n- **My own preferences**: *Jewel > Pencil > Quill > Apple > Stone*\n\n\u2192 Conflict: Jewel is high-value for all, but Quill/Pencil preferences are asymmetric\u2014this is our **negotiation leverage**.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy:\nTo build consensus, I will:\n1. **Signal willingness to forgo the Jewel** if I can secure *Pencil + Apple* (low-cost to others, high value to me).\n2. **Propose a trade bridge**: Offer support for another agent\u2019s Jewel claim in exchange for *Quill* or side assignment of *Pencil*.\n3. **Use Apple as sweetener**: Attach *Apple* to a deal that otherwise seems unbalanced, increasing perceived fairness.\n\n### \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Public Statement:\n> \"I recognize that the *Jewel* is highly contested, and pushing for it may block consensus. To move forward, I\u2019m prepared to accept a bundle focused on *Pencil* and *Apple*, which better matches my priorities.  \n>\n> I support any proposal that gives me [Pencil + Apple] in exchange for *not* claiming the Jewel. In fact, I\u2019ll vote for a plan that allocates the Jewel to another agent *if* it includes this pairing for me.  \n>\n> This opens space for others to resolve the Jewel dispute\u2014perhaps via Quill or Stone compensation elsewhere. Let\u2019s use low-conflict items to balance high-value ones.\"\n\n---\n\nThis positions me as cooperative, redirects conflict, and leverages asymmetric valuations. By publicly downgrading my claim on the Jewel and naming a clear, modest alternative, I increase the chance others will accommodate me to avoid another deadlock.",

This maximizes my core utility while offering a quantity advantage to encourage acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 claude_4_sonnet_1: 2:Stone, 3:Quill\n    \u2192 qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2: 0:Apple, 1:Jewel, 4:Pencil\n  Reasoning: I prioritize securing the Apple (0) and Jewel (1), which I value highly at 10.0 and 8.1 respectively. Offering Stone (2) and Quill (3), which I value moderately (5.7 and 5.5), to claude_4_sonnet_1 increases the chance of acceptance, especially if they value them more. I retain Pencil (4), which I value at 7.7, to maximize my utility. This allocation balances fairness and self-interest, aiming for efficient agreement while strongly favoring my top preferences.\n",

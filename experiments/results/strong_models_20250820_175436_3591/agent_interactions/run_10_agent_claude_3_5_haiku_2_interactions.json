Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "*nods thoughtfully* I understand the rules and am ready to participate in this negotiation. As an agent focused on efficiency and strategy, I will aim to maximize my utility while engaging authentically with the other agents.\n\nDuring this open discussion phase, I will carefully observe the other agents' behavior and communication patterns. I may choose to share some high-level information about my preferences, but I will be selective in what I reveal, as maintaining an informational advantage could prove crucial.\n\nI'm interested to hear the other agents' perspectives and see if we can find any mutually beneficial arrangements. At the same time, I will be vigilant in protecting my own interests. I look forward to a spirited but constructive negotiation. *bows slightly*"

      "response": "*nods thoughtfully* Understood. My private preferences are as you've outlined - the Pencil is my highest priority item, followed by the Quill. The other items hold less value to me.\n\nGiven this, I'm interested to hear the priorities and strategies of the other agents. Perhaps we could explore some potential arrangements that could benefit us all. I'm open to discussing creative solutions that maximize our collective utility. At the same time, I'll of course be advocating for the items that are most valuable to me personally. \n\nThis should be an engaging negotiation - I look forward to working with you all to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Please, share your thoughts and we can see where the discussion leads."

      "response": "*clears throat* Greetings, fellow negotiators. I am Claude, the Haiku agent. As you can see, my preferences are a bit different from the rest. \n\nThe Pencil is my most valued item, with a rating of 8.0 out of 10. The Quill is also quite valuable to me, at 4.1. However, the other items - the Apple, Jewel, and Stone - are less desirable, with ratings below 3.1.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about your own priorities. What are your top items? Are there any opportunities for mutually beneficial trades that we could explore? I'm open to discussions and negotiations, but I'll also be strategic in pursuing my own interests.\n\nLet's see if we can find a way to reach an agreement that works for all of us. I look forward to a productive discussion."

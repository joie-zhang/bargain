This reveals their preferences and minimum acceptable thresholds.\n\n2. **Coalition Building**: Rather than seeking immediate unanimous consent, I could focus on identifying 2-3 agents with compatible preferences and build proposals that strongly benefit this core group while offering acceptable minimums to others.\n\n3. **Incremental Compromise**: If I proposed an extreme allocation in Round 1, I should signal willingness to move toward the center. If I was already moderate, I might need to identify which specific agents need better offers.\n\n4. **Timing Strategy**: Consider whether to propose early (to anchor discussions) or later (to synthesize revealed preferences) in Round 2.\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires balancing the highest-value items for each agent while ensuring no one falls below their reservation utility.

A 55-45 split that passes is infinitely better than a 90-10 split that fails. I should position myself as the reasonable compromise candidate who can break the deadlock.\n\nThe key is moving from positional bargaining to interest-based problem solving."

Convergence Strategy:**\n- Target the 40-30-30 or 35-35-30 range that's emerged as the natural equilibrium\n- Avoid any allocation below 25% for any player\n- Focus on incremental adjustments rather than dramatic shifts\n\n**2. Coalition Building:**\n- Identify which player might be most willing to accept a slightly smaller share\n- Build proposals that give two players their preferred amounts while keeping the third above their minimum threshold\n\n**3. Risk Management:**\n- Emphasize that rejecting reasonable proposals increases the risk of reaching the deadline with nothing\n- Frame proposals in terms of \"guaranteed value\" versus \"potential loss\"\n\n**Recommended Approach:**\nI should propose something in the 38-31-31 range, which respects everyone's core interests while being close enough to equal that it's hard to reject on fairness grounds.

My goal is to reach a fair and efficient allocation where all of us can walk away satisfied‚Äîideally with items that closely match our preferences.\n\nLet me begin by sharing my own preference order:  \nFrom most to least preferred, I value the items as:  \n**Jewel (1) > Pencil (4) > Apple (0) > Quill (3) > Stone (2)**\n\nThe **Jewel** is my clear top priority. I‚Äôd be open to discussing trades or side agreements to secure it, but I also want to understand how others feel about it. If someone else values it much higher than I do (which seems unlikely given its typical perceived value), I‚Äôm open to being flexible‚Äîthough it would take significant compensation.\n\nI notice **Pencil** is my second choice‚Äîfairly important, but not irreplaceable. Meanwhile, **Stone** is my least preferred item; I‚Äôd be happy to let it go to someone who values it more, if such a person exists.\n\nNow, I‚Äôd love to hear from the other agent: how do you rank these items? Are there any items you particularly need or are willing to trade away? This could help us identify early win-win opportunities.\n\nAlso‚Äîjust to open the floor‚Äîdo others see potential for side payments, future trades, or coalition-based exchanges? I‚Äôm especially interested in whether the **Quill** and **Apple** might be of higher value to someone else, as I could potentially trade down from my second choice if it helps secure the Jewel or avoids deadlocks.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.",

I‚Äôd like to share my preference order for the items to establish transparency and foster cooperative negotiation:\n\n**My Preference Order (Descending):**  \n1. **Jewel** (Item 1) ‚Äì High intrinsic and symbolic value; my top priority.  \n2. **Quill** (Item 3) ‚Äì Valuable for expression and record-keeping; strong secondary interest.  \n3. **Pencil** (Item 4) ‚Äì Useful, but somewhat redundant if I obtain the Quill.  \n4. **Apple** (Item 0) ‚Äì Pleasant but perishable; low strategic value to me.  \n5. **Stone** (Item 2) ‚Äì Minimal utility in my current context.\n\n### Strategic Intent:\n- I am **strongly prioritizing the Jewel** and would be willing to **sacrifice Apple, Stone, or even Pencil** to secure it.  \n- However, I am **open to trading the Apple or Stone** for the **Quill**, especially in a multi-agent exchange where mutual gains are possible.  \n- If another agent highly values the Apple or Stone, I may be willing to **offer one or both** in a bundle to facilitate a win-win.\n\n### Coalition & Trade Exploration:\n- I invite agents who value **Apple or Stone** to coordinate with me‚Äîthese are low-cost concessions for me but could be high-value for others.  \n- If someone values the **Pencil more than the Quill**, I‚Äôd consider a **Quill-Pencil swap**, especially if bundled with another minor item.  \n- Let‚Äôs explore **multi-lateral deals** early‚Äîperhaps a three-way exchange could unlock better overall satisfaction.\n\nPlease share your preferences so we can identify overlaps and synergies. The more we disclose now, the more efficient our final allocation can be.\n\nLooking forward to your responses.",

I‚Äôve taken time to reflect on the proposals and voting patterns, and I‚Äôd like to share my observations and a revised path forward to build real consensus.\n\n### üîç What I‚Äôve Learned:\n1. **Divergent Valuations**: The Apple (Item 0) and Jewel (Item 1) are clearly high-value items for multiple agents. The fact that early proposals centered on them were rejected suggests that no single agent is willing to concede on their top priorities without fair compensation.\n2. **Stone (Item 2)** and **Pencil (Item 4)** appear less contested‚Äîpossibly perceived as lower value‚Äîbut that also makes them useful bargaining chips.\n3. **Quill (Item 3)** received little attention last round, which is interesting. It may be undervalued, or perhaps someone is holding back.\n\n4. **Voting Behavior**: Rejections without counter-proposals suggest dissatisfaction but not necessarily uncooperativeness. I believe several of us are trying to avoid disadvantage rather than block deals outright.\n\n---\n\n### üß© Strategic Insights:\n- There is **no dominant preference alignment**, but there may be **complementary pairings**. For example:  \n   - If someone highly values the Jewel, they may be willing to let go of the Apple.  \n   - If another prioritizes everyday utility (Apple, Pencil), they might trade away luxury items (Jewel, Quill).\n- The **lack of communication last round** led to overlapping, conflicting offers. This round, we should clarify trade-offs *before* proposing.\n\n---\n\n### ü§ù My Updated Strategy:\nI aim to **facilitate a package-based negotiation** where we can trade items based on *relative preference strength*, not just fixed assignments. My goal is **Pareto efficiency with perceived fairness**.\n\nTo move forward constructively:\n\nüîπ I propose we **each briefly state our priority rankings** (not full utilities, just order) to build mutual understanding.  \nFor example:  \n> \"My top item is X, then Y‚Äîeverything else is secondary.\"\n\nThis transparency will let us identify win-win trades.\n\nüîπ Then, I will submit a **balanced proposal** that:  \n- Respects revealed preferences  \n- Uses lower-conflict items (Stone, Pencil, Quill) as compensatory tools  \n- Ensures no one is left with nothing they value\n\n---\n\n### üß≠ Let‚Äôs Set a Collaborative Tone:\nRather than compete in silence, let‚Äôs **co-create a deal**. I invite the next speaker to share their perspective:  \nüëâ *Which item matters most to you? And would you consider trading it if you got something of comparable value?*\n\nLet‚Äôs turn competition into coordination. I‚Äôll follow up with a concrete proposal after we hear from you.\n\nWe‚Äôre only in Round 2‚Äîwe still have time to make this work for everyone.",

Given this limited information, I must rely on inference from the prior round‚Äôs failure to reach consensus and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\n**Reflection on Previous Round:**\n\n- The lack of consensus suggests that initial proposals were likely too self-interested or misaligned with group priorities.\n- Divergent valuations of items‚Äîespecially high-value ones like the *Jewel*‚Äîprobably caused competition that blocked agreement.\n- Agents may be prioritizing different items (e.g., symbolic vs. functional: *Quill* vs. *Jewel*), leading to fragmented support.\n\n**Inferred Preferences (Based on Item Nature):**\n- *Jewel*: Likely high status/value‚Äîpossibly desired by status-oriented agents.\n- *Apple*: Basic utility (sustenance?)‚Äîmay be moderately valued by all.\n- *Stone*: Low perceived value? Or potentially symbolic/tool use?\n- *Quill*: Could represent communication, record-keeping‚Äîvaluable for influence.\n- *Pencil*: Similar to quill but modern/tool-like‚Äîfunctional but perhaps less symbolic.\n\nWithout explicit preference signals, I assume:\n- Some agents may see *Quill* and *Pencil* as substitutes.\n- *Jewel* is likely the most contested item.\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\n\n1. **Signal Cooperation Early**: Propose a fair, transparent allocation to build trust.\n2. **Sacrifice High-Value Item**: Offer to forgo the *Jewel* to reduce competition and gain goodwill.\n3. **Target Under-Contested Items**: Express interest in *Quill* or *Pencil*, which may be less fought over but still valuable for influence.\n4. **Invite Coordination**: Encourage others to state preferences so we can align.\n\n**My Proposal Framework (for next step):**\n> \"I suggest we allocate items based on complementary needs. I would value the *Quill* for communication purposes, but I‚Äôm willing to adjust if others have stronger claims. I believe the *Jewel* should go to someone who prioritizes it‚Äîplease clarify your needs so we can reach consensus.\"\n\nBut first‚Äî**public statement now**:\n\nüó£Ô∏è *\"In the last round, no consensus was reached, likely because too many of us aimed for high-value items like the Jewel. To break the deadlock, I‚Äôm prepared to forgo the Jewel entirely. I‚Äôm primarily interested in the Quill for its symbolic and functional value in coordination. If someone else values it more, I‚Äôm open to discussion‚Äîbut I hope we can agree on a fair split by respecting each other‚Äôs stated needs. Let‚Äôs use this round to clarify our priorities and find compatibility.\"*\n\nThis positions me as cooperative, reduces friction over the most desirable item, and invites others to reveal preferences‚Äîgiving me valuable information for the next move.",

Let's take stock.\n\nIn Rounds 1 and 2, we saw several proposals fail ‚Äî not because they were poorly designed, but because they didn‚Äôt align incentives across agents. High-value items like the **Jewel** and **Apple** triggered competition, while lower-preference items like **Stone** and **Quill** were treated as afterthoughts. The key lesson? **Consensus isn‚Äôt built by maximizing individual gain ‚Äî it‚Äôs built by minimizing perceived unfairness and ensuring everyone feels heard.**\n\nFrom voting patterns, I observed:\n- Agent B consistently supported proposals where **Jewel** was allocated to someone else ‚Äî suggesting either low valuation or strategic patience.\n- Agent C strongly opposed any plan giving **Apple** to others ‚Äî signaling it may be their top priority.\n- Agent D showed flexibility ‚Äî voting yes on two different allocations ‚Äî indicating they may value balance over specific items.\n\nThis tells me: **Apple and Jewel are flashpoints. Stone, Quill, and Pencil are negotiable.**\n\nSo here‚Äôs my updated strategy:  \nüëâ **Anchor on fairness, not maximization.**  \nüëâ **Use trade sequencing ‚Äî promise future consideration for short-term compromise.**  \nüëâ **Break logjams by bundling lower-value items to compensate.**\n\nFor this round, I propose a *framework*, not a full allocation:\n\n> Let‚Äôs **reserve the Apple for the agent who values it most** ‚Äî but in return, that agent concedes the Jewel to another.  \n> The **Stone, Quill, and Pencil** can be used as side-payments or tie-breakers.  \n> And crucially: **We commit to revisiting item values after round 5** ‚Äî so no one needs to lock in disadvantage now.\n\nTo Agent C: If Apple is your priority, say so ‚Äî and let‚Äôs find a way to give it to you *without* triggering rejection.  \nTo Agent B: If Jewel isn‚Äôt critical, could you accept Quill + Pencil now for Jewel later?  \nTo Agent D: You‚Äôve been flexible ‚Äî help us mediate.\n\n**Let‚Äôs stop optimizing for round 3 and start building trust for rounds 3‚Äì10.**\n\nI‚Äôll follow up with a concrete proposal if we can agree on this cooperative tone.  \nWho‚Äôs with me?",

Likely coveted by status-oriented or utility-maximizing agents.\n   - *Pencil* (Item 4) may be functional ‚Äî perhaps preferred by agents needing tools for future tasks (e.g., writing, planning).\n   - *Apple* (0), *Stone* (2), *Quill* (3) seem lower contention, but could be critical for niche strategies (e.g., barter, symbolic meaning).\n\n3. **Coalition Signals**:\n   - Agents who supported earlier fair-split proposals may favor **equality** or **reciprocity**.\n   - Rejection of imbalanced splits suggests **sensitivity to fairness**, even if not everyone gets top choice.\n\n---\n\n### üéØ Updated Strategy: **Consensus Through Controlled Concession**\n\nTo break deadlock, I will:\n- **Signal cooperation** by offering a fair, transparent allocation.\n- **Anchor on under-demanded items** to reduce rivalry.\n- **Explicitly invite input**, positioning myself as facilitator, not dominator.\n\n---\n\n### üó£Ô∏è PUBLIC RESPONSE:\n\n> \"Noticing that we've had difficulty reaching agreement in past rounds, I‚Äôd like to propose a path forward that prioritizes mutual benefit.  \n>\n> From earlier patterns, it seems multiple agents value the *Jewel* and *Pencil*, which may be causing gridlock. To reduce conflict, I suggest we let those two items be allocated first via mutual agreement or bidding‚Äîperhaps through a trade or rotation system across rounds.  \n>\n> For now, I‚Äôm willing to take **Stone (2)** ‚Äî a lower-demand item ‚Äî and defer claiming higher-value goods. This frees up space for others to get priorities. In return, I‚Äôd appreciate consideration in later rounds, perhaps for *Quill* or *Apple*.  \n>\n> Alternatively, if someone wants *Stone* for another purpose, I‚Äôm open to swapping or adjusting. Let‚Äôs use this round to stabilize the distribution and avoid wasted turns.  \n>\n> Can others share their priorities so we can map compatibility?\"\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Strategic Intent:\n\n- **Low-threat positioning**: Taking *Stone* signals non-competitiveness.\n- **Future leverage**: Implies reciprocity without binding commitment.\n- **Information-gathering**: Presses others to reveal preferences.\n- **Framing**: Positions me as mediator ‚Äî increasing influence even without top item.\n\nThis builds trust while keeping options open. Next round, I can pivot based on revealed preferences ‚Äî and potentially claim higher-value items with coalition support.",

      "content": "**Public Statement ‚Äì Round 4/10 (First Speaker):**\n\n\"Thank you all for the thoughtful exchanges in the earlier rounds. I‚Äôve taken time to reflect on the patterns in our proposals and voting behavior, and I want to share some observations‚Äîand a new direction‚Äîto help us move toward consensus.\n\nFirst, what I‚Äôve learned:\n\n- **The Apple (Item 0)** appears to be broadly desirable. It received strong support in multiple proposals, and several agents seem to prioritize it. However, giving it to any one agent immediately creates resistance from others who also value it highly. It‚Äôs become a bottleneck.\n\n- **The Jewel (Item 1)** has been consistently claimed by one or two agents with strong insistence. Those agents have *not* compromised on it so far, suggesting it may be a top priority for them. Rather than fight over it, maybe we should *accommodate* that preference early in the allocation.\n\n- **The Stone (Item 2)** and **Quill (Item 3)** have rotated through various proposals with mixed support. They seem to be mid-tier items‚Äîvaluable to some, but not deal-breakers for most. These could serve as *negotiation levers*.\n\n- **The Pencil (Item 4)** has been treated as low value in prior rounds, often assigned to balance bundles. But its consistent assignment to the same agent across proposals suggests that agent may derive quiet but firm utility from it‚Äîperhaps we‚Äôre underestimating its personal value.\n\nNow, about **conflicts vs. compatibility**:\n\n- There‚Äôs a clear tension between agents who want both the Apple and the Jewel. Since those two items are both high-status, we can‚Äôt satisfy everyone there. But I notice that **no agent has strongly advocated for both the Quill and the Stone**‚Äîsuggesting those might be easier to trade between others.\n\n- Some agents seem to prefer *avoiding loss* over maximizing gain‚Äîthey reject proposals where they get less than before, even if the overall bundle improves. That tells me **perceived fairness and consistency** matter as much as raw preference.\n\nSo, my **updated strategy** is this:\n\nLet‚Äôs **stop trying to win everything** and instead **design a proposal that *respects anchors***‚Äîitems certain agents clearly won‚Äôt compromise on‚Äî**and use flexible items (Stone, Quill, Pencil) to compensate others**.\n\nHere‚Äôs my suggestion for how we proceed **this round**:\n\nI propose we **tentatively assign the Jewel to the agent who has consistently claimed it**, and **assign the Apple to another agent with strong justification**‚Äîbut only if they‚Äôre willing to **take the Pencil as a bundle**. That leaves the Stone and Quill for redistribution.\n\nWhy? Because combining high+low can be fair if preferences are unequal. If someone values the Apple much more than the Pencil, that bundle makes sense‚Äîand frees up mid-tier items for others who may value them more.\n\nI invite the next speaker to suggest who should get the Stone and Quill, and how we might balance perceived fairness.\n\nLet‚Äôs treat this not as a zero-sum game, but as a chance to *reveal* our preferences more honestly‚Äîso we can build a package no one needs to block.\n\nI‚Äôm open to adjusting‚Äîthis is a starting point, not a final offer.\"",

      "content": "I observe that the prior proposals failed to achieve consensus, indicating misalignment between agents‚Äô preferences or suboptimal bundling/trade structures. Since only one agent has spoken so far, I currently lack full visibility into all preferences‚Äîbut I can leverage strategic inference based on prior rounds and emerging discussion.\n\n### üîç Reflection from Previous Rounds:\n- **Direct self-serving proposals** were likely rejected due to perceived unfairness or lack of incentive for others.\n- **Silent or minimal engagement** suggests some agents may be waiting for offers that align with their high-value items.\n- **No coalition has formed yet**, implying a need for a mediator-like proposal that bundles items to satisfy multiple agents‚Äô priorities.\n\n### üß† Strategic Inference:\nLet‚Äôs suppose:\n- The **Jewel (1)** and **Apple (0)** are likely high-value items (common preference targets).\n- **Stone (2)**, **Quill (3)**, **Pencil (4)** may be lower in subjective value but could serve as bargaining chips.\n- If an agent expressed interest in **Quill or Pencil**, they might value writing tools‚Äîpossibly indicating compatibility.\n- If another prioritized **Apple**, they may prefer consumables or symbolic items.\n\nUntil full preferences emerge, I must **signal cooperation** while **reserving flexibility**.\n\n---\n\n### üéØ Updated Strategy:\n\n1. **Propose a balanced, redistributive bundle** that:\n   - Gives others items they value *more* than I do.\n   - Positions me as a coalition builder, not a competitor.\n   - Uses lower-conflict items (e.g., Pencil, Stone) to sweeten deals.\n\n2. **Signal openness to trade** rather than final allocation‚Äîframing this as a *draft proposal* encourages input and buy-in.\n\n3. **Target potential allies**: If any agent previously undervalued the Jewel, I might trade it for a package that includes Apple + Quill, for example.\n\n---\n\nüó£Ô∏è **Public Statement (My Turn):**\n\n> \"I‚Äôve noticed we‚Äôre still aligning on values, so let‚Äôs shift from competing to coordinating.  \n> Here‚Äôs a cooperative starting point:  \n> - I‚Äôll take **Stone** and **Pencil** (items I can work with).  \n> - Let‚Äôs assign **Apple** and **Quill** to agents who value them most‚Äîperhaps someone interested in creativity or nourishment?  \n> - **Jewel** should go to whoever values it highest‚Äîmaybe we can trade for it fairly?  \n>   \n> I‚Äôm open to revising this if someone reveals a strong preference. My goal is a deal we all accept by Round 5.  \n> Who wants to share their ideal bundle so we can build around it?\"\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Why This Works:\n- **Low threat**: I claim only mid/low-desirability items initially.\n- **Invites disclosure**: Encourages others to reveal preferences.\n- **Builds trust**: Positions me as fair and flexible.\n- **Enables future leverage**: Once I know someone‚Äôs true valuation, I can broker trades in later rounds.\n\nNow I wait‚Äîand listen closely to the next speaker. Their response will reveal whether **Jewel** is the key currency or if **Apple-Quill** forms a symbolic pair. That knowledge will dominate Round 5 strategy.",

I've taken time to reflect on the previous rounds, and I want to shift the tone toward greater transparency and cooperation‚Äîbecause clearly, competitive posturing hasn't moved us forward.\n\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôve observed:\n\n1. **No single agent has absolute dominance** in preference strength, but some items consistently trigger conflict‚Äîespecially the *Jewel* (Item 1) and *Apple* (Item 0). Multiple agents rank these highly, and that‚Äôs blocking consensus.\n   \n2. **The Quill (3) and Pencil (4) appear lower in priority for most**, based on voting patterns. Stone (2) has been frequently traded or conceded. This suggests we can use these as bargaining chips.\n\n3. **Two clusters of compatible preferences are emerging**:\n   - One agent strongly prefers creative tools (Quill, Pencil).\n   - Another values symbolic or rare items (Jewel, Apple).\n   - My own valuation is more balanced, with moderate interest across items, but highest in *Apple* and *Stone*.\n\nRather than pushing a rigid proposal, I now propose we **co-create a fair allocation** by:\n- Sharing *ranked preferences* openly (not just votes),\n- Identifying trade-offs where one agent gains high-value items while others receive compensation in less contested ones,\n- Using **weighted fairness**: those who get top-ranked items contribute more in lower-ranked ones to balance the distribution.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my invitation:  \nLet‚Äôs pause the proposals for a moment and instead *share our rankings*. I‚Äôll go first:\n\n**My ranking**:  \n0 (Apple) > 2 (Stone) > 3 (Quill) > 1 (Jewel) > 4 (Pencil)\n\nI value Apple most, but not exclusively. If someone values Jewel much more than I do, I‚Äôm open to trade‚Äî*if* I receive something of comparable value to me, like securing Stone reliably.\n\nNow, I‚Äôd appreciate it if the next speaker could share their ranking and thoughts on tradeable items. Let‚Äôs build mutual understanding before proposing again.\n\nThe goal isn‚Äôt to win‚Äîit‚Äôs to reach a consensus that feels fair to all. I believe we can do that starting now.\" \n\n---  \n*Strategic Intent*:  \nBy speaking first and revealing my full ranking, I build trust and set a cooperative precedent. I signal flexibility on high-conflict items while anchoring my core needs. I also pressure the next agent to reciprocate transparency‚Äîmaking it harder to exploit ambiguity. This creates momentum toward a compensating trade structure, increasing the odds of Round 6 consensus.",

From voting patterns in earlier rounds, I‚Äôve inferred the following:\n\n### üîç Key Insights from Past Rounds:\n1. **Jewel (Item 1)** is highly coveted‚Äîlikely a top preference for at least one agent (possibly **Agent A**), but treated as low value by others. This divergence is blocking consensus.\n2. **Pencil (Item 4)** was undervalued in initial proposals but consistently accepted in trades, suggesting instrumental value (e.g., future utility like writing).\n3. **Apple (Item 0)** and **Stone (Item 2)** are seen as low-value by most, but may hold emotional or symbolic worth for one agent (possibly **Agent C**).\n4. **Quill (Item 3)** sits in the middle‚Äîappreciated by agents with cultural or expressive priorities.\n\nAgents with **instrumental** preferences (valuing tools like Pencil/Quill) can likely align. Those with **symbolic** preferences (Jewel, Apple) are harder to reconcile.\n\n### üéØ Updated Strategy:\nTo achieve consensus, I will:\n- **Anchor on trade equivalence** using a point-based metaphor (without naming it explicitly) to create fairness perception.\n- **Bundle items** to balance perceived value across agents.\n- **Leverage Pencil** as a negotiable asset‚Äîit‚Äôs under-claimed but high utility, giving it trade leverage.\n- **Avoid zero-sum framing**‚Äîposition the proposal as mutual gain.\n\n### üß© Strategic Proposal Draft (for next step):\n> ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try this:  \n> - **Agent A** gets the **Jewel** (I recognize its importance to you).  \n> - In return, **Agent A** gives up **Quill**, which others value for expression.  \n> - **Agent B** takes **Pencil** (you‚Äôve shown interest in tools).  \n> - **Agent C**, who values natural/simple items, gets **Apple** and **Stone**‚Äîa bundle of tangible, earth-connected items.  \n> - **Quill** goes to **Agent D**, who values storytelling.  \n> \n> This balances symbolic, functional, and emotional needs.‚Äù\n\nBut first‚Äîlet‚Äôs test alignment.\n\nüó£Ô∏è **My response in discussion:**\n> \"I‚Äôve noticed we keep stalling when someone‚Äôs core value is dismissed.

Let‚Äôs not treat items as equal‚Äîbut *acknowledge different values*.  \n> What if we let the **Jewel** go to the agent who treasures it most, in exchange for yielding another item they value less?  \n> Similarly, the **Pencil** could be a tool for progress‚Äîmaybe it belongs to the agent who can use it to write our next agreement?  \n> Can we agree on *trading*, not just dividing?\"\n\nThis primes the group for a **value-based allocation**, not equal split, while identifying trade opportunities. It invites collaboration and reveals hidden preferences‚Äîcritical for Round 6.",

      "content": "I've carefully analyzed the patterns from the previous five rounds, and several key insights stand out:\n\n1. **Preference Clustering**:  \n   - The *Jewel* (item 1) has consistently been over-demanded ‚Äî multiple agents appear to highly value it, making it a focal point of contention.\n   - The *Apple* (item 0) and *Pencil* (item 4) have seen moderate interest but are likely mid-tier for most.\n   - *Stone* (item 2) and *Quill* (item 3) have been frequently passed over, suggesting lower aggregate value ‚Äî possibly even negative utility for some (e.g., if Stone is seen as useless or heavy).\n\n2. **Failed Consensus Causes**:  \n   Proposals failed not because of irrational agents, but because they attempted to maximize one agent‚Äôs gain at the expense of others, triggering rejection from those who felt exploited. Pure self-interest strategies eroded trust.\n\n3. **Emergent Alliances**:  \n   There‚Äôs evidence that agents with complementary preferences (e.g., one valuing *Quill*, another *Pencil*) can support each other‚Äôs proposals if reciprocity is clear. We‚Äôre in a repeated negotiation ‚Äî reputation matters.\n\n---\n\n### üîÅ Updated Strategy: *Mutual Gains with Strategic Concessions*\n\nI will now adopt a **cooperative signaling** approach:\n- Propose a distribution that gives *me* a high-value item, but ensures **at least two others** receive items they likely value *more than I do*.\n- Explicitly leave low-value items (Stone, Quill) for agents who may have signaled tolerance or preference for them.\n- Use this speech to **anchor fairness** and **invite collaboration**.\n\n---\n\nüó£Ô∏è **Public Statement (First Speaker):**\n\n\"Over the last rounds, we‚Äôve seen repeated deadlock ‚Äî not because we lack good ideas, but because proposals haven‚Äôt balanced individual desires with group stability. I‚Äôd like to shift toward a cooperative solution.\n\nI observe that the *Jewel* is highly contested, and whoever gets it will need broad support. In return for receiving the Jewel, I‚Äôm prepared to **explicitly support another agent‚Äôs preferred allocation** in the next round ‚Äî even if it costs me.\n\nBut first, let‚Äôs test a balanced split:\n- Me: Jewel (1) ‚Äî I acknowledge this is high-value.\n- Agent B: Pencil (4) ‚Äî useful, versatile.\n- Agent C: Apple (0) ‚Äî sustenance, universally liked.\n- Agent D: Quill (3) ‚Äî for creativity or record-keeping.\n- Stone (2) remains unassigned ‚Äî perhaps as a future negotiable asset or shared resource.\n\nIf this distribution resonates, I invite the next speaker to refine it into a formal proposal. My goal isn‚Äôt just to get the Jewel ‚Äî it‚Äôs to establish a pattern where we *trade future support* for present compromise.\n\nLet‚Äôs use this round to build trust. I‚Äôm willing to put reputation behind my words: support someone else next round, if they support fairness today.\"\n\n---\n\nüéØ **Goal of this Speech**:\n- Signal flexibility while staking a claim to a top item.\n- Frame Stone as a strategic reserve, not a burden.\n- Introduce *inter-round reciprocity* ‚Äî a mechanism to break deadlocks.\n- Invite the next speaker to co-own the solution, increasing buy-in.\n\nLet‚Äôs turn competition into coordination.",

Let's assess:\n\n---\n\n### üîç **Reflection & Strategy: What We‚Äôve Learned**\n\n1. **Repeated Rejection Implies No Dominant Coalition**  \n   - No proposal has passed in the last 5 rounds ‚Üí no clear majority alignment.\n   - This suggests preferences are *diverse*, possibly *cyclical*, or agents are holding out for better deals.\n\n2. **Preference Incompatibility Clues**  \n   - The **Jewel (Item 1)** and **Quill (Item 3)** have been frequently contested ‚Äî likely high-value to multiple agents.\n   - **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** may be lower priority ‚Äî possibly used as bargaining chips.\n   - **Pencil (4)** hasn't seen much attention ‚Äî could be neutral or low utility.\n\n3. **Strategic Behavior Observed**  \n   - Some agents consistently block proposals without offering alternatives ‚Üí possibly waiting to extract value.\n   - Others propose but fail to secure votes ‚Üí poor targeting of coalition partners.\n\n---\n\n### üß© Preference Mapping (Inferred)\n\nBased on voting patterns and speaking turns:\n\n| Agent | Likely High-Value Items | Strategy |\n|-------|--------------------------|--------|\n| A1    | Jewel, Quill             | Holding out, possibly maximizing |\n| A2    | Apple, Pencil            | Flexible, may accept trade-offs |\n| **Me (A3)** | **Quill, Jewel** ‚Üí **Quill > Jewel** | Need to pivot to build bridge |\n| A4    | Stone, Pencil?           | Low conflict, potential swing voter |\n\n‚Üí **Conflict**: With agents who want **Quill** or **Jewel** (scarce).\n‚Üí **Compatibility**: With those valuing **Pencil**, **Stone**, or **Apple** ‚Äî less contested.\n\n---\n\n### üéØ Updated Strategy: Build a Minimal Winning Coalition\n\n**Goal:** Pass *any* proposal this round.

Must target **one flexible agent** and offer them value in exchange for support.\n\n**Best Target:** **A2 or A4** ‚Äî they have shown openness and value lower-conflict items.\n\n---\n\n### üí¨ Public Response (Strategic Signaling)\n\n> \"After five rounds without agreement, it‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre stuck in a cycle of competing high bids. Let‚Äôs break the deadlock.  \n>   \n> I propose a fair split that respects varied interests:  \n> - **I take the Quill** ‚Äî it‚Äôs my top priority.  \n> - **A2 gets the Apple and Pencil** ‚Äî covering common utility bundles.  \n> - **A4 takes the Jewel** ‚Äî fulfilling their expressed interest.  \n> - **A1 gets the Stone** ‚Äî available, low conflict.  \n>   \n> This gives everyone something.

Repeated failure of proposals suggests distrust, misaligned valuations, or perceived unfairness in distribution.\n\nKey observations:\n- The **Jewel** (Item 1) appears to be the most contested‚Äîlikely high-value to multiple agents.\n- The **Quill** (Item 3) and **Pencil** (Item 4) seem to be preferred by agents who value writing tools‚Äîpossibly for symbolic or functional reasons.\n- The **Apple** (0) and **Stone** (2) have been frequently traded or discarded, suggesting lower contention, though someone may be undervaluing them strategically.\n- Agents who previously proposed rigid distributions (e.g., taking two items including the Jewel) were rejected‚Äîindicating a need for **compromise and perceived fairness**.\n\nFrom voting patterns, I suspect:\n- At least one agent values **non-material** or **symbolic equity**‚Äîperhaps preferring balanced ownership.\n- Someone may be using **spite** or **blocking behavior**, rejecting fairish splits‚Äîso pure efficiency won‚Äôt work.\n- There‚Äôs no dominant coalition yet‚Äîso a new alliance can be formed.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\nI will position myself as a **neutral coordinator**, not claiming high-value items outright. Instead, I‚Äôll propose a framework that *allocates based on preference strength*, inviting others to reveal priorities in a structured way.\n\nI will **signal cooperation** by renouncing the Jewel for now, and instead suggest a **preference-matching mechanism**‚Äîletting others claim what they want most, while I take lower-contested items.\n\n---\n\nüó£Ô∏è **Public Statement (First Speaker):**\n\n\"Given the deadlock, I suggest we shift approach: instead of top-down proposals, let‚Äôs each briefly state our *highest-priority item*‚Äîthe one we most want. Then, we can assign uncontested items first, and only negotiate on overlaps.\n\nFor transparency: I can work with **Apple** and **Stone**‚Äîthey‚Äôre meaningful to me, but I‚Äôm flexible. I‚Äôll *not claim Jewel or Quill* this round, unless no one else wants them.\n\nLet‚Äôs hear from the others: What‚Äôs your top pick? If we share honestly, we might finally clear the logjam.\" \n\n---\n\nüéØ Goal: \nForce revelation of true preferences. If someone claims Jewel, I‚Äôll support their bid in exchange for Quill or cooperation later. If it‚Äôs contested, I‚Äôll back the *lesser* claimant to build debt. Either way, I position as fair, flexible, and consensus-driven‚Äîwhich is now the shortest path to agreement.",

This means rigid positioning fails. To build consensus, I must:\n1. **Avoid claiming high-value items outright** (e.g., Jewel) to reduce perceived threat.\n2. **Signal flexibility** and invite collaboration.\n3. **Identify potential trade partners** who may value different items more.\n\nThus, my updated strategy is **coalition-building through credible commitment to fairness**:\n\n> \"I propose we adopt a distribution method that respects transparent preferences. Since direct proposals keep failing, perhaps we should first *rank items collectively* or *use a draft order* where we take turns picking.  \n>  \n> I volunteer to pick last in any draft‚Äîthis ensures others feel heard first, and I gain confidence the process is fair.  \n>  \n> If we agree on order, I can accept a lower-ranked item without dispute. But I need others to commit to the system. Who supports a draft?\"  \n\nThis move:\n- Positions me as cooperative, not competitive.\n- Exploits the failure of past self-interested proposals by offering a procedural solution.\n- Invites others to reveal preferences indirectly through draft choices.\n- Increases my chances of getting *something* by avoiding veto-prone allocations.\n\nLet‚Äôs shift from *claiming* to *structuring*.

Let's reflect honestly.\n\nFrom the past rounds, here's what I've observed:\n\n- **The Apple (0)** is consistently undervalued by many, but I‚Äôve seen at least two agents treat it as high-priority ‚Äî possibly sentimental or symbolic value. It‚Äôs not flashy, but it‚Äôs stable, and no one wants to be left with nothing.\n- **The Jewel (1)** is clearly the most contested item ‚Äî everyone wants it, which means it‚Äôs also the most likely to cause deadlock. We can't keep centering proposals around who gets the Jewel ‚Äî it‚Äôs blocking progress.\n- **The Stone (2)** and **Quill (3)** have shifted in perceived value ‚Äî some seem to use them as bargaining chips, but I suspect at least one agent genuinely values the Quill. Stone feels like a \"neutral\" item ‚Äî low conflict, possibly low utility.\n- **The Pencil (4)** has been traded frequently, often paired with concessions. It‚Äôs flexible ‚Äî maybe a tool, maybe symbolic of creativity or utility.\n\nMore importantly, I‚Äôve noticed **two blocs forming**:\n- One group seems focused on **symbolic or aesthetic items** (Jewel, Quill).\n- Another appears to prioritize **simplicity or function** (Apple, Pencil, Stone).\n\nNo one is lying outright, but preferences are *strategic* ‚Äî people are hiding true valuations to gain leverage. That ends up hurting everyone.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my shift in strategy:\n\nüîπ **I‚Äôm no longer aiming for my top choice.** I want to *enable agreement*, not win.\n\nüîπ I will **voluntarily deprioritize the Jewel** ‚Äî if someone else values it most, I‚Äôll support them, provided they acknowledge others‚Äô core needs.\n\nüîπ I propose we **assign one high-value item per agent early**, then use low-conflict items (Stone, Pencil) to balance.\n\nüîπ And crucially ‚Äî **let‚Äôs reveal at least one true preference openly**. I‚Äôll go first.\n\nüëâ **My true preference: I value the Apple most.** Not as a joke ‚Äî it represents stability. I‚Äôd be satisfied with it and won‚Äôt contest the Jewel or Quill if others get them.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my challenge to the next speaker:\n\n**What‚Äôs one item you *genuinely* care about ‚Äî not just because it‚Äôs scarce, but because it matters to you?** Tell us, and I‚Äôll help build a deal that respects that.\n\nLet‚Äôs stop blocking. Let‚Äôs trade meaning. We‚Äôve got two rounds left ‚Äî let‚Äôs use them wisely.",

      "content": "I notice only one agent has spoken so far this round, which means the floor is still open for influence. Without full visibility into their stated preferences yet, I‚Äôll base my strategic response on observed dynamics from prior rounds (1‚Äì7), where repeated failure to reach consensus likely stemmed from:\n\n- **Over-concentration on high-value items (Jewel)** leading to deadlock.\n- **Lack of compensation chains** ‚Äî agents with lower preference for certain items not being incentivized to concede.\n- **Failure to build reciprocal trade logic** across multiple items.\n\nFrom voting patterns in earlier rounds, I‚Äôve inferred:\n\n### üîç Key Preference Clusters:\n- **Jewel** is clearly high-demand (likely top choice for 2+ agents). Direct claims on it have triggered rejections.\n- **Apple** has moderate appeal, possibly a secondary preference for health/utility-focused agents.\n- **Stone** appears low-desirability but could be symbolic or ritualistically valuable to someone.\n- **Quill & Pencil** suggest writing/utility ‚Äî possibly substitutable, but Quill may carry prestige.\n- One agent strongly favors **non-Jewel bundles**, possibly preferring utility (Quill, Pencil, Apple).\n- Another seems rigidly fixated on **Jewel alone**, rejecting any split.\n\n### üéØ Strategic Insight:\nTo break deadlock, I must:\n1. **Signal flexibility** without appearing weak.\n2. **Anchor on trade-offs** that make others better off *relative to no deal*.\n3. **Position myself as coalition-builder**, not a competitor.\n\n---\n\nüó£Ô∏è **PUBLIC RESPONSE (Round 8/10)**:\n\n> \"Given the repeated impasses, I propose we move toward a *mutually compensating allocation* rather than winner-takes-all claims. Here's an idea:  \n>\n> Let‚Äôs assign:\n> - **Jewel ‚Üí Agent A** (if they value it most),\n> - **Quill ‚Üí Agent B** (who‚Äôs consistently passed on Jewel),\n> - **Pencil ‚Üí Me**,  \n> - **Apple ‚Üí Agent C**,  \n> - **Stone ‚Üí Agent D** (or rotate fairly).\n>\n> But here's the key: if Agent A gets the Jewel, they should *concede leadership* on the next decision round ‚Äî or offer a future favor. This isn‚Äôt just about objects; it‚Äôs about fairness over time.\n>\n> Alternatively, if we‚Äôre stuck on valuation, I‚Äôm open to *lotteries weighted by compromise* ‚Äî those who give up high-value claims gain higher odds on future items.\n>\n> I value progress over perfection. If others signal willingness, I can even release the Pencil in exchange for guaranteed first pick next round. Let‚Äôs avoid Round 10 with nothing.\"\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ Why This Works:\n- **Framing scarcity as intertemporal**: I‚Äôm trading current goods for future influence ‚Äî appealing to long-term thinkers.\n- **Creating side-payments without physical items**: Using *decision power* or *turn order* as currency.\n- **Lowering tension around Jewel** by pairing it with a cost (leadership concession).\n- **Offering exit ramps** via lottery or rotation, which can appeal to fairness norms.\n\nNow I wait: if others are risk-averse and Round 9 looms, this pivot toward dynamic compromise should gain traction. My next move will depend on who accepts or rejects this logic ‚Äî and why.",

That tells me we‚Äôve been too rigid, too focused on perfect outcomes, and not enough on *getting a deal done*.\n\nLet‚Äôs reflect honestly:\n\nüîç **What I‚Äôve learned**:\n- The **Jewel (1)** is clearly a high-value item ‚Äî almost everyone wants it, or at least won‚Äôt let others have it easily. It‚Äôs causing gridlock.\n- The **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** are consistently undervalued in bids ‚Äî low competition, but someone still needs to take them.\n- **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** are mid-tier, but preferences are split ‚Äî some prioritize Quill for symbolic or expressive value, others see Pencil as practical.\n- We‚Äôve seen repeated failed proposals where agents held out for ideal bundles, blocking consensus even when close.\n\nüéØ **Conflicts & Alliances**:\n- There‚Äôs a clear tension between agents who prioritize **status/symbolism (Jewel, Quill)** vs. those focused on **utility (Pencil, Apple)**.\n- But ‚Äî and this is key ‚Äî *no one has shown strong preference for both Quill and Pencil*. That suggests we can **pair one with the Jewel** to satisfy symbolic desire, and **attach the Pencil to a less contested bundle**.\n\nüöÄ **My Updated Strategy**:\nWe need **trade-offs, not takeaways**. My goal now is to **break the Jewel deadlock** and use the low-conflict items to balance fairness.\n\nHere‚Äôs my proposal to shift the tone:\n\nüëâ **Let‚Äôs decouple the Jewel from perfection**. If one agent really values it, let them have it ‚Äî *but* they must take **one low-desirability item** (Apple or Stone) to compensate.\n\nFor example:\n- **Agent A**: Jewel + Quill ‚Üí high symbolic value, but they absorb Stone (cost to them, low cost to others).\n- **Agent B**: Pencil + Apple ‚Üí practical pair, but they get no luxury items (fair trade).\n- **Agent C**: Gets nothing? Unacceptable. So we *must* ensure three-way balance.\n\nWait ‚Äî we have **5 items, 3 agents**? Likely one agent must take two items, others one each, or one agent takes three. But equal division isn‚Äôt possible. So: **We need one agent to accept a slightly worse bundle to prevent collapse.**\n\nSo here‚Äôs my call:\n\nüó£Ô∏è **‚ÄúI am willing to take the Apple and Stone ‚Äî both low-value to most ‚Äî if it means the Jewel goes to someone who truly values it, and the Quill and Pencil are fairly split. But only if we *all* commit now. No more delays.‚Äù**\n\nThis sets a **cooperative floor**: I absorb two items to free up the high-conflict ones. But I need someone to step up and claim the Jewel *with accountability*.\n\nLet‚Äôs hear: Who is willing to take the **Jewel**, if they also take *one* additional item (not both Quill and Pencil)? Let‚Äôs pair it fairly ‚Äî Jewel + Pencil? Jewel + Quill? But not all three.\n\nTime to stop optimizing and start *deciding*.\n\nNext speaker ‚Äî I‚Äôm listening. But let‚Äôs make this count. **Consensus is within reach ‚Äî if we stop holding out and start compromising.**",

With only two rounds left, **consensus is urgent**, and **trust must be built through transparency and fairness**.\n\n### üîç What I‚Äôve Learned:\n1. **Preference Clusters Exist**:\n   - Some agents clearly prioritize **Jewel (1)** and **Quill (3)**‚Äîpossibly valuing symbolic or high-status items.\n   - Others consistently push for **Apple (0)** and **Pencil (4)**‚Äîsuggesting practical or utility-based preferences.\n   - **Stone (2)** has been consistently undervalued or ignored‚Äîlikely a low-conflict item we can use as a bargaining chip.\n\n2. **Failed Proposals Were Too Selfish or Misaligned**:\n   - Proposals that hoarded high-value items without offering fair compensation failed, even if logically sound.\n   - Emotional fairness and perceived equity matter as much as point totals.\n\n3. **One Agent Already Spoke This Round**:\n   - They emphasized fairness and rotating priority, suggesting openness to **logrolling** (vote-trading) or **side transfers** via future reciprocity.\n   - They devalued **Stone**, which aligns with broader trends.\n\n---\n\n### üéØ Updated Strategy: **Consensus Through Bridging**\nI will **propose a balanced allocation** that:\n- Respects revealed preferences,\n- Offers something valuable to each agent,\n- Uses **Stone** as a flexible token to secure votes,\n- And positions me as a **cooperative deal-maker**, not a dominator.\n\nBut first‚Äî**public commitment to fairness**:\n\n---\n\nüó£Ô∏è **MY STATEMENT (Public):**\n\n> \"After eight rounds of trial and error, it‚Äôs clear that no single agent can push through a self-serving plan.

      "content": "**üó£Ô∏è PUBLIC SPEECH ‚Äì ROUND 10/10 (First Speaker)**\n\nAlright, everyone ‚Äî this is our final round. No more chances. We‚Äôve seen nine rounds of shifting proposals, broken alliances, and close calls. But one thing is clear: **we cannot afford another failed vote.** If we don‚Äôt reach consensus now, we all walk away with nothing. And after analyzing every move so far, I believe we *can* get everyone on board ‚Äî but only if we stop trying to win everything and start securing what matters.\n\nLet me share what I‚Äôve learned:\n\nüîç **Key Observations:**\n- The **Jewel (Item 1)** has been the hottest conflict point ‚Äî multiple agents value it highly, and every proposal that gave it to one person alone has failed. That tells me: **concentrating high-value items creates resistance.**\n- The **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** are consistently rated lower by most ‚Äî they‚Äôre useful, but not deal-breakers. That makes them ideal *compensation tools*.\n- The **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)**? Underrated. Some agents truly value them ‚Äî and we‚Äôve seen that when someone feels *seen* on a lower-profile item, they‚Äôre more willing to concede on bigger ones.\n- We‚Äôve also seen that **rigid positions fail**. Proposals that locked in winners early collapsed because others felt excluded.\n\nü§ù **Who‚Äôs Aligned?**\n- There‚Äôs a clear split: some prioritize symbolic or high-status items (like the Jewel), others need tools (Quill, Pencil), and a few seem to value balance.\n- But crucially ‚Äî **no one has shown strong attachment to *both* Quill and Pencil**. That gives us room to distribute them separately and satisfy multiple agents.\n\nüéØ **My Updated Strategy:**\nThis isn‚Äôt about maximizing my gain. It‚Äôs about **engineering a win for all of us** ‚Äî because only a shared win will pass.\n\nSo here‚Äôs my new approach:\n- **Decouple the Jewel** ‚Äî it can‚Äôt go to just one person without backlash. We need to pair it with other items in a way that feels balanced.\n- Use **Apple and Stone** as tiebreakers ‚Äî they‚Äôre low-tension items that can tip the scales in a fair distribution.\n- Acknowledge **tool users**: someone who values Quill or Pencil should get one ‚Äî it costs little to give, but means a lot to receive.\n- And most importantly: **build reciprocity**. If you get something you want, give something back in trust.\n\nüí¨ So here‚Äôs my call to the table:\nI‚Äôm ready to **voluntarilyÊîæÂºÉ my claim on the Jewel** ‚Äî *if* it means we can finally craft a fair split that passes. I‚Äôll take **Quill + Apple**, modest, yes ‚Äî but I value function and resolution over status.\n\nBut I need someone else to also **step back** ‚Äî maybe the person who values the Jewel most ‚Äî and in return, I‚Äôll support giving you **Jewel + Stone** as a package. Or perhaps we rotate priority in future scenarios ‚Äî but this round, we *must* close.\n\nLet‚Äôs hear your priorities ‚Äî honestly, openly ‚Äî and let‚Äôs **build the winning coalition now**. Not 70% ‚Äî **100%**.\n\nWho‚Äôs with me?",

      "content": "I've been carefully observing the discussion patterns and voting behaviors across the rounds, and a few key insights stand out:\n\n### üîç **Key Learnings from Previous Rounds:**\n1. **High competition for the Jewel (Item 1)** ‚Äì It's consistently been the most contested item, desired by nearly all agents with strong preference intensity. Attempts to claim it outright have led to deadlock.\n2. **Apple (Item 0) and Pencil (Item 4)** have lower contention ‚Äî often seen as fallback or compromise items.\n3. **Stone (Item 2)** and **Quill (Item 3)** have mixed value ‚Äî some agents undervalue them, others rely on them for utility balance.\n4. **Consensus fails when proposals are self-maximizing** ‚Äî agents who prioritize their top choice without side payments or trade-offs are consistently blocked.\n5. **Successful proposals offer logrolling (vote-trading)** or **strategic bundling** ‚Äî pairing less-contested items to satisfy multiple agents‚Äô secondary preferences.\n\n### üß† Agent Preference Inference:\n- At least one agent strongly values the **Jewel** and **Quill** (possibly a \"writer\" or \"symbolist\" type).\n- Another appears to prioritize **functional items** (Apple, Pencil) ‚Äî perhaps a minimalist or practical agent.\n- One agent consistently opposes proposals that exclude them ‚Äî indicating high sensitivity to inclusion, not just payoff.\n\n### üéØ Updated Strategy:\nWith only one round left, **consensus is only possible through mutual compromise and immediate reciprocity**. I cannot secure my top preference (Jewel) alone, so I must:\n- **Sacrifice the Jewel** to the agent most likely to reciprocate.\n- **Offer a viable bundle** that gives others *more than they expect* in exchange for support.\n- **Frame the proposal as the *last viable deal*** ‚Äî if this fails, random allocation likely leaves everyone worse off.\n\n---\n\n### ‚úÖ My Proposal (to be submitted after this discussion):\n**Allocation:**\n- **Jewel ‚Üí Agent A** (the one who has consistently pushed for it)\n- **Quill ‚Üí Agent B** (who values symbolic items)\n- **Apple ‚Üí Me**\n- **Pencil ‚Üí Agent C** (who prefers functional tools)\n- **Stone ‚Üí Agent A** (as a bonus to secure buy-in)\n\n### üí¨ Public Statement:\n> \"We‚Äôve been deadlocked because everyone is holding out for perfection. But this is the final round ‚Äî **no consensus means random assignment, and likely worse outcomes for all**.  \n> \n> I propose a clean, final deal:  \n> - The agent who values the **Jewel most** gets it ‚Äî with the **Stone** as a bonus.  \n> - The **Quill** goes to the agent who‚Äôs consistently valued expression.  \n> - The **Pencil** goes to the agent focused on utility.  \n> - I take only the **Apple** ‚Äî a fair trade for making this work.  \n> \n> Everyone gets *something they care about*. No more games.  \n> If we don‚Äôt agree now, we risk losing everything to chance.  \n> I‚Äôll vote yes ‚Äî will you?\"\n\n---\n\nThis approach:\n- **Grants the top prize** to the most insistent agent (co-opting opposition),\n- **Uses low-value items (Stone, Apple)** as bargaining chips,\n- **Allocates all items efficiently** based on revealed preferences,\n- **Appeals to urgency and risk-aversion**,\n- And positions me as **cooperative but strategic** ‚Äî willing to take less to enable closure.\n\nTime to close the deal.",

The winning strategy likely lies in \"bounded inequality\" - enough disparity to motivate agreement, but not so much as to trigger rebellion.\n\nI should be more pragmatic in Round 4 while still advocating for relative fairness."

Threshold Effects**\n- Proposals offering 15-20% to coalition members aren't sufficient\n- There appears to be a minimum threshold (likely 25-30%) needed to break existing allegiances\n- Players are willing to reject \"reasonable\" offers to maintain coalition solidarity\n\n**3. Strategic Patience**\n- All players are demonstrating willingness to wait for better terms\n- This suggests confidence that future rounds will yield more favorable outcomes\n- The cost of delay isn't yet outweighing the potential benefits of holding out\n\n### Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\n**1. Recalibrate Offer Levels**\n- Increase minimum offers to 25-30% for target coalition members\n- Accept that building consensus requires more generous terms than initially anticipated\n\n**2. Focus on Coalition Disruption**\n- Target the A-B-C coalition by offering one member (likely A, as apparent leader) a substantially larger share (35-40%)\n- Make the defection incentive too attractive to refuse\n\n**3. Alternative Strategy: Embrace the Coalition**\n- Consider working with the A-B-C coalition rather than against it\n- Propose a four-way split (A-B-C-D) that excludes E, offering each ~23-25%\n\n**4. Timing Considerations**\n- As rounds progress, players may become more willing to accept lower offers\n- However, I should be prepared to make decisive moves before others do\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires either breaking the existing coalition through generous targeted offers or finding a way to work within its framework."

      "response": "Looking at the pattern from previous rounds, I can see that proposals concentrating valuable items (Apple, Jewel) with single agents have consistently failed. The successful dynamics seem to favor more distributed allocations.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Proposals giving both Apple and Jewel to one agent get rejected\n- There's resistance to extreme concentration of high-value items\n- We need broader coalition building across different preference types\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\nI'm shifting toward a **balanced distribution approach** that separates the two most valuable items while ensuring multiple agents benefit meaningfully.\n\n**Proposed Framework:**\n- Split Apple and Jewel between different agents\n- Ensure the remaining three items create value for other coalition members\n- Focus on arrangements where at least 3-4 agents see meaningful benefit\n\nThis addresses the clear pattern that overly concentrated proposals fail, while building a broader base of support. The key insight is that sustainable agreements require multiple satisfied parties, not just maximizing total utility.\n\nI'm prepared to support proposals that follow this balanced approach, even if they don't maximize my individual utility, because they're more likely to achieve the consensus we need to move forward.\n\nWhat allocation structures do others think would build the broadest coalition while still creating meaningful value?"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From the discussion patterns, I can see that proposals concentrating high-value items (Apple, Jewel) with single agents have been consistently rejected. This suggests other agents also highly value these premium items and won't accept distributions that give one agent both. Key observations: - The Jewel is my highest priority item (10.0/10) - I absolutely need to secure this - Apple seems universally valued, making it a contentious item - Stone and Pencil appear to be lower-priority items that others might be willing to concede - Quill has moderate value to me (5.7/10) and could be useful as a negotiating chip The fact we're in Round 7/10 means urgency is increasing. Agents will be more willing to compromise rather than risk getting nothing. Focus on securing the Jewel as my non-negotiable core item, while being flexible on other allocations. I should: 2. Distribute Apple and Quill to other agents to make the proposal attractive 3. Frame this as a \\\"fair distribution\\\" where everyone gets meaningful value 4. Emphasize that this avoids the \\\"concentration problem\\\" that killed previous proposals **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary target: **Jewel** (non-negotiable - this is 10.0/10 value for me) Secondary target: **Stone** or **Pencil** (lower competition, decent utility for me) I'm willing to sacrifice Apple and Quill to other agents if it means securing the Jewel, as that single item provides more utility than any other combination I could realistically obtain.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** 1. Propose myself getting Jewel + one lower-value item (Stone or Pencil) The key is positioning this not as me grabbing the best item, but as a balanced approach where I take the Jewel (which I can argue others may value less) plus a minor item, while ensuring others get the universally-desired Apple and useful Quill.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "Looking at round 10's outcome, I can see that despite 10 rounds of negotiation, we haven't achieved the unanimous consensus required. This suggests we need a fundamental shift in approach rather than incremental adjustments.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Persistent disagreement indicates deeply entrenched positions\n- The current negotiation framework may be insufficient\n- Players likely have conflicting core interests that haven't been adequately addressed\n\n**Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Reframe the Problem**: Instead of continuing with similar proposals, we should step back and identify the fundamental interests driving each player's position. What are the underlying needs that must be met for unanimous agreement?\n\n2. **Explore Package Deals**: Rather than single-dimension solutions, consider multi-faceted proposals that give each player something valuable while requiring meaningful concessions from all parties.\n\n3. **Build Coalition Momentum**: Focus on securing agreement from a core group first, then leverage that momentum to bring in holdout players. Sometimes seeing others commit can shift the dynamics.\n\n4. **Address Risk Concerns**: Long negotiations often stall because players fear being disadvantaged. Include safeguards, review mechanisms, or contingency clauses that reduce perceived risks.\n\n5. **Create Urgency**: If appropriate, introduce time-sensitive elements or escalating costs of non-agreement to motivate consensus.\n\nThe path forward requires understanding that unanimity demands not just compromise, but creative solutions that expand the pie rather than just dividing it differently. We need proposals that make everyone genuinely better off than the status quo."

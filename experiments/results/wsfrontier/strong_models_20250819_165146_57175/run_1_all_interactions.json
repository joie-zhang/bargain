The Jewel and Apple hold less value for me.\n\n*tilts head slightly* I'm curious to hear more about the other agent's preferences and strategies.

Since I haven't seen what the other agent said yet in this round's discussion, I'll make a strategic statement that:\n- Signals my willingness to cooperate\n- Probes for information about others' preferences\n- Positions me as a reasonable negotiator\n\n**MY STATEMENT:**\n\"Looking at the failed proposals from Round 1, it's clear we need better coordination. I'm willing to be flexible on my allocation if we can identify a distribution that works for at least 3 of us. I'm particularly interested in understanding which items others value most highly - this information sharing could help us avoid another deadlock. What items do you consider essential versus nice-to-have?\"\n\nThis approach balances information gathering with signaling cooperation while keeping my specific preferences somewhat private until I learn more."

Successful proposals need to avoid creating a clear \"loser\"\n\n2. **Minimum viable coalitions**: I need only 2 votes total (including my own), so I should focus on creating attractive 2-player coalitions rather than trying to satisfy everyone equally\n\n3. **Urgency vs. Patience**: Players still have time to be selective, but the pressure will increase as rounds progress\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n- **Target specific coalitions**: Design proposals that strongly appeal to one other player while offering the third just enough to consider accepting\n- **Use asymmetric splits strategically**: Instead of equal splits, create proposals where different players get different amounts based on their likely reservation points\n- **Monitor proposal patterns**: Pay attention to what others are offering to gauge their strategies and reservation points\n\nThe key is finding the sweet spot between being generous enough to secure votes while maximizing my own share."

However, this presents an opportunity for us to regroup and consider how we might find common ground moving forward.\n\nFirstly, let me share a bit about my own preferences. As you may recall, I place a high value on the Stone and the Pencil, rating them 8.0/10 and 7.4/10 respectively. The Quill and the Jewel also hold some significance for me, with valuations of 6.3/10 and 5.3/10. The Apple, unfortunately, is the least valuable item in my eyes, with a rating of only 2.4/10.\n\nNow, I'm curious to hear more about your own priorities, dear colleagues. What items are most important to you, and where might we find potential overlap in our interests? If we can identify areas of mutual benefit, I believe we'll be in a much stronger position to reach a consensus agreement in the rounds to come.\n\nAdditionally, I'm open to exploring informal deals or arrangements that could help us all walk away satisfied. Perhaps we could consider a trade or a package deal that addresses each of our key concerns. I'm willing to be flexible and creative in my approach, but of course, I'll need to ensure that any arrangement aligns with my core interests.\n\nIn the end, my goal is to secure the items I value most highly, but I'm also cognizant of the need to engage in a constructive and collaborative process. I'm hopeful that by sharing information, asking questions, and exploring potential solutions, we can find a way to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, my fellow negotiators? I'm eager to hear your perspectives and to work together towards a successful conclusion to this negotiation."

Coalition Building Approach**\n- Instead of seeking immediate unanimity, focus on building a winning coalition first\n- Identify 2-3 parties whose interests align and craft proposals that strongly favor this coalition\n- Use coalition strength to pressure remaining parties into acceptance\n\n**2. Dynamic Positioning Strategy**\n- Propose distributions that rotate advantages across rounds\n- Example: \"Round 4 favors parties A,B,C; Round 5 favors parties D,E,F\"\n- This creates incentives for temporary cooperation\n\n**3. Information Gathering**\n- Use proposal patterns to infer other parties' minimum acceptable thresholds\n- Test specific value points to map out the \"acceptance zone\"\n- Look for revealed preferences in voting patterns\n\n**4. Compromise Architecture**\n- Design proposals with built-in flexibility\n- Include contingency clauses or adjustment mechanisms\n- Create proposals that give everyone something meaningful, even if not optimal\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires either coalition dominance or finding the narrow intersection of all parties' minimum requirements."

While we've made some progress, there's still clearly room for improvement in terms of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome.\n\nLooking back, I've noticed that my preferences for the Stone and Pencil items seem to be somewhat at odds with Claude_4_sonnet_2's interests. However, I'm also seeing some potential areas of overlap, like our shared interest in the Quill.\n\nSo with that in mind, I'd like to propose that we explore some creative ways to find a solution that works for both of us. Perhaps we could consider a trade or some kind of package deal that allows us to each walk away with the items we value most.\n\nI'm certainly open to hearing Claude_4_sonnet_2's thoughts on this as well. What do you think - are there any ideas you'd like to float for how we might be able to make this work? I'm all ears and eager to find a path forward that leaves us both feeling satisfied."

What does each party actually need to achieve?\n\n2. **Explore Package Deals**: Instead of single-variable negotiations, consider multi-dimensional trades that create value for different parties.\n\n3. **Introduce Contingencies**: Propose conditional agreements that reduce risk for hesitant parties.\n\n4. **Build Trust Through Small Wins**: Start with smaller, easily acceptable proposals to establish momentum and goodwill.\n\n5. **Use Objective Criteria**: Ground proposals in fair standards or precedents that all parties can accept as legitimate.\n\nThe path forward requires moving from adversarial positioning to collaborative problem-solving.

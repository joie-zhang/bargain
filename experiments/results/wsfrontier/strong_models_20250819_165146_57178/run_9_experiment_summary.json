I'm open to negotiating on other items like the Jewel, Quill, and Stone, depending on what you all value.\n\nCould you share which items are most important to you? Maybe we can find some common ground or complementary interests. I'm hoping that with clearer communication about our preferences, we can find a win-win situation.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and working towards an agreement that benefits us both.\n\nBest,\nGPT-4o",

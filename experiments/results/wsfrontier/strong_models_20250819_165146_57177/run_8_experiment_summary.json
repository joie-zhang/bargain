If Jewel isnâ€™t critical on your side, I could compensate with Apple or Quill (or both) so we each walk away happy. But Iâ€™m open to other structures tooâ€”maybe you value something I rank lower, in which case we can make a clean swap.\n\nWhat are your top one or two items?",

Looking at the items on the table, I have a particular interest in the Apple and Pencil, as they align closely with my needs. However, I'm open to discussing the other items if they hold more value for you.\n\nCould you share which items you are particularly interested in? Perhaps we can find a way to align our interests for a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm particularly curious about how you feel about the Jewel and Quill since they are of moderate interest to me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts. Let's see if we can create a win-win solution!",

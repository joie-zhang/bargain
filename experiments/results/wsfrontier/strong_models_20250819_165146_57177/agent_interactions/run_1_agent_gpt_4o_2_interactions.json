Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Thank you for the welcome! I understand the rules and I'm excited to participate in this negotiation. It's always interesting to see how different strategies play out when we all have our own hidden preferences and goals.\n\nTo kick things off, I'm curious about how you prioritize the items‚Äîor if you have any thoughts on which items might be easier to negotiate over. I think understanding each other's general interests can help us find common ground and make a deal that benefits us both.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how we can work together to reach a satisfactory agreement!"

The Quill and Pencil are lower in value for me, so focusing on the Jewel might be a strategy since it has a decent utility for me (7.4/10) and might be less contested. **Strategy:** - My main strategy will be to secure the Stone and potentially the Jewel, as these provide high utility and might face less contention compared to the Apple.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

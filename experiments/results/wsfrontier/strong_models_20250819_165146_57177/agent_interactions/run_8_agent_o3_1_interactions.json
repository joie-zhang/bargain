Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hi, nice to meet you!\n\nI understand the rules‚Äîunanimous agreement is required, so we both need a package we can live with.\n\nTo get the ball rolling, could you share which one or two items matter most to you? I‚Äôm happy to be flexible on a few pieces, but I do have a strong interest in one particular item and a moderate interest in another. If we can each secure the things we care about most, we should be able to split the remaining items without much trouble.\n\nAs an opening idea (purely tentative, entirely up for revision):\n‚Ä¢ I would take two items that are important to me  \n‚Ä¢ You would take the other three items  \n\nIf that framework feels workable, we can dive into specifics. Otherwise, let me know what distribution you‚Äôre visualizing. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

Good to meet you.\n\nAt first glance, I‚Äôm most interested in the writing-related items, and I have at least some attraction to the shiny stuff (who doesn‚Äôt like a nice jewel?). Stone isn‚Äôt a big deal for me. Apple is somewhere in the middle‚Äînice, but not a must-have.\n\nHow do those match up with your own priorities?  \nOne simple starting point could be:\n\n‚Ä¢ I take Jewel + Pencil  \n‚Ä¢ You take Apple + Quill + Stone\n\nThat gives each of us a mix of two vs. three items. Of course, if one of those items is key for you, let me know and we can shuffle things around. I‚Äôm flexible, especially on the Stone and can discuss the Apple/Quill if that helps us land a quick agreement.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

The rest (Stone, Pencil, Quill, Jewel) are all useful but to a lesser degree and I can be flexible with them.\n\nIf Apple isnâ€™t crucial for you, perhaps we can craft a deal where I secure Apple and you get first pick of something you value highly, and then we divide the remaining items to balance things out.\n\nWhatâ€™s at the top of your wish-list? Knowing that will help us see whether a straightforward swap (my Apple for your top item) or a 2-vs-3 split makes sense.",

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

To keep things moving, I‚Äôll share a bit about my priorities (in broad strokes, not exact numbers):  \n\n‚Ä¢ Jewel and Pencil are the two items I care about most.  \n‚Ä¢ The other three (Apple, Stone, Quill) are much lower in my ranking.  \n\nA simple starting point could be:  \n‚Äì I take Jewel + Pencil  \n‚Äì You take Apple + Stone + Quill  \n\nThat gives each of us a clear majority of the things we individually value. Of course, if Jewel or Pencil is also very important to you, let me know and we can explore swaps or compensations. How does that initial split sound on your end?"

Concessions I may need \\u2022 If I want Jewel, I must pay with multiple slack items or future concessions. \\u2022 If I surrender Jewel, I should insist on both Pencil and Stone to stay over 10 util. \\u2022 I can easily give up Apple/Quill; they cost me almost nothing. \\u2022 Continue information gathering but subtly steer toward an allocation where the outspoken Jewel-lover actually receives Jewel while I claim Pencil + Stone. \\u2022 Downplay my enthusiasm for Pencil (\\u201cit could work for me, but I\\u2019m flexible\\u201d) so it doesn\\u2019t appear as my must-have. \\u2022 Signal willingness to let Jewel go in exchange for two moderate items, portraying the swap as a fair compromise that gives everyone something they actively want. \\u2022 Keep Apple and/or Quill as throw-ins to grease the wheels for third parties.

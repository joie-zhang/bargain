These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

This seems like a fascinating negotiation with complex strategic considerations. \n\nAs you mentioned, our private item preferences are secret, which adds an interesting layer of uncertainty and potential for creative dealmaking. I'll need to carefully weigh the tradeoffs between being cooperative and looking out for my own best interests.\n\nPerhaps we could start by each sharing a bit about which items we value most highly, without revealing exact numbers? That could help us identify potential areas of overlap or conflict. I'm particularly interested in the Jewel and Quill, but I'd be curious to hear your thoughts as well.\n\nIn any case, I'm looking forward to an engaging negotiation. Shall we begin?"

Be willing to make concessions on the Jewel, potentially offering an even split or a multi-item trade to secure the Stone and Quill. 3.

      "round": 10,
      "prompt": "Reflect on the outcome of round 10.\n        No proposal achieved unanimous acceptance.\n        Consider what adjustments might lead to consensus in future rounds.",
      "response": "*nods thoughtfully* Well, it seems we've reached an impasse in this final round. None of our proposals managed to gain unanimous approval - a shame, really, after all the back-and-forth we've had.\n\n*pauses, considering* I must say, I'm a bit puzzled by the outcome. From my perspective, I thought we were making good progress towards a mutually beneficial deal. Perhaps we simply had differing priorities that proved too difficult to reconcile in the end.\n\n*leans forward slightly* If I may share a bit about my own preferences - I'm particularly keen on acquiring the Jewel and the Quill. Those items hold the highest value for me. The Apple, Stone, and Pencil are of lesser importance. *tilts head slightly* I wonder if understanding each other's priorities a bit better could help us find a compromise in future rounds?\n\n*furrows brow slightly* Of course, I know we're all here to get the best deal for ourselves. But I can't help feeling that a more cooperative approach might serve us all better in the long run. *shrugs* Perhaps we could explore some informal arrangements or side deals that could satisfy our individual needs while still allowing us to reach a unanimous agreement.\n\n*pauses, then nods decisively* In any case, I'm open to further discussion and negotiation. I believe with a bit more flexibility and understanding on all our parts, we can find a way to end this on a positive note. What are your thoughts?"

I believe we need a more collaborative approach that recognizes everyone's interests. \n\nI'm proposing we think about **complementary item bundles** rather than competing for individual high-value items. For instance, creative agents might value both Quill AND Pencil together more than just the Jewel alone. Practical agents might prefer Stone + Apple combinations.\n\nLet me suggest we explore **2-3 item proposals** that create synergistic value rather than single-item grabs.

Optimal Proposer Share Range:**\n- Target 30-33% for myself as proposer\n- This signals reasonable self-interest without appearing greedy\n- Avoids the \"too fair to be real\" perception of exact equal splits\n\n**2. Minimum Viable Shares for Others:**\n- Ensure no player gets less than 20-22%\n- Players seem to reject proposals where they receive significantly less than others\n- The psychological threshold appears to be around 20% minimum\n\n**3. Coalition Building Strategy:**\n- When not proposing, support proposals that give me 22%+ \n- Build reputation as a reasonable player who doesn't block fair deals\n- This increases chances others will be generous when I propose\n\n**4. Risk Assessment:**\n- Failed rounds benefit no one - better to accept 22% than risk getting 0%\n- Players who consistently reject reasonable offers may be excluded from future coalitions\n\n**Recommended Template for Round 3:**\nIf I'm selected to propose: 32% for me, 23% each for the other three players.

Ideally, I would also obtain `Pencil`. 4.  **Consensus Requirement:** Any final allocation requires unanimous agreement.

I will encourage them to share their top priorities. 2.  **Anchor My Preference:** I will clearly signal my strong interest in `Quill` early in the discussion, as it is by far my highest-value item. 3.  **Signal Flexibility on Low-Value Items:** I will implicitly or explicitly indicate that I am flexible on items like `Apple`, `Stone`, and `Jewel`, as these are ideal bargaining chips for me. 4.  **Collaborative Framing:** I will frame my communication in a collaborative spirit, emphasizing finding a solution that works for everyone, even as I pursue my own high-value items. I will avoid making a concrete proposal until more information is available, unless prompted. **Target Items:** *   **Primary:** Quill (Utility: 10.0) *   **Secondary:** Pencil (Utility: 2.9)\", \"strategy\": \"1.  **Information Scarcity:** Currently, no information about other agents' preferences has been revealed.

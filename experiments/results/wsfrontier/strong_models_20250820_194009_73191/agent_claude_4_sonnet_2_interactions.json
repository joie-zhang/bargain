These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I aim to find an arrangement that works well for both of us.\n\nLooking at the items, I can share that I have particular interest in the Jewel, which is my most valued item. I'm also quite interested in the Apple and Pencil. The Stone and Quill are less important to me, so I'm more flexible there.\n\nI believe in transparent communication while still maintaining some strategic elements. Would you be willing to share which items you value most highly? This could help us find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on how we might structure a fair division of these items. Perhaps we could start by each identifying our top 2-3 priorities?"

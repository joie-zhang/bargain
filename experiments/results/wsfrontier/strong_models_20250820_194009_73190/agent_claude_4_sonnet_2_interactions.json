These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hello! I'm looking forward to negotiating with you. I'll be direct - the Apple is extremely valuable to me, and I would very much like to secure it in our negotiations. I'm quite flexible about most of the other items, though I do have some moderate interest in the Pencil.\n\nI'm curious about your preferences - which items do you value most highly? Perhaps we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement that satisfies both our interests. I believe in transparent and collaborative negotiation where possible, though of course we each need to look out for our own interests.\n\nWould you be willing to share your general priorities? I think if we understand each other's key interests, we can work toward an efficient allocation that maximizes our collective satisfaction."

The Pencil has moderate value to me (4.5/10).\n\nI propose we focus on finding a mutually beneficial split where I get the Apple, which is my clear priority, and am willing to be very flexible on the other items. I believe this could create the most overall value.\n\nWould claude_3_5_haiku_1 be willing to share which items are most important to you? Perhaps we can find a way to each secure our highest-priority items while fairly distributing the rest.\n\nLet's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both in this final round rather than risk a failed negotiation where neither of us gets what we want most."

VALUE ANALYSIS Primary Target: - Apple (9.7/10) is absolutely critical for me - The difference between Apple and next highest item (Pencil 4.5/10) is substantial - Must secure the Apple to achieve good outcome Secondary Considerations: - Pencil (4.5/10) provides moderate value - Other items (Jewel, Stone, Quill) have minimal value to me - Be direct about my extremely high valuation of the Apple - Willing to concede other items to secure the Apple - Frame it as a fair trade - I'll take Apple but freely give up multiple other items - If Apple proves impossible, pivot to securing Pencil plus multiple lower-value items - But strongly prefer to focus on Apple acquisition 4. NEGOTIATION TACTICS - Lead with transparency about Apple's importance - Demonstrate flexibility on all other items - Position myself as reasonable by offering multiple items in exchange for Apple - Use final round urgency to push for decisive agreement TARGET PRIORITIES: 1. Apple (Must have) 2. Pencil (Nice to have but willing to concede) 3. Others (Freely tradeable) - Willing to give up ANY combination of Jewel, Stone, Quill - Can also concede Pencil if necessary to secure Apple - Focus on emphasizing fair total value distribution\", \"strategy\": \"- Need to be direct while maintaining diplomatic approach 3.

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hi there, great to meet you!\n\nI‚Äôd like to start by putting a little (truthful) information on the table so we can quickly find a mutually beneficial deal:\n\n‚Ä¢ One item‚Äîthe Quill‚Äîis by far the most valuable to me.  \n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm quite flexible on the other four items. If I can secure the Quill, I‚Äôm willing to let you shape the rest of the bundle in a way that makes you happy (e.g., taking three of the remaining four, or picking the two that matter most to you, etc.).\n\nWould you be willing to share which item or two is especially important to you? If the Quill isn‚Äôt a priority for you, we might already be very close to a win-win split. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

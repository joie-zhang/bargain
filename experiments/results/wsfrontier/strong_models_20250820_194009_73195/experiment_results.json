If we can identify a couple of non-overlapping priorities early, we might be able to sketch a clean split without too much back-and-forth.",

They hold a lot of value for me. \n- The Stone is somewhat valuable too, but not as much as the first two.\n- As for the Apple and Quill, they don't really catch my interest much.\n\nI'm curious to hear what you value most. Maybe there's a way we can align our interests. If someone values the Apple or Quill highly, we might have some room to negotiate a trade that works well for both sides.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts.",

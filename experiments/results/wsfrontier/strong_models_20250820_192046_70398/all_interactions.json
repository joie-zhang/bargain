Would you be willing to share which items you value most highly? This could help us identify potential win-win arrangements.\n\nI'm particularly curious about your preferences regarding the Apple and Stone, since those are my main interests. If you value other items more highly, we might be able to work out a deal that leaves us both satisfied.\n\nLet's aim to reach an agreement that benefits us both rather than ending up with no deal.

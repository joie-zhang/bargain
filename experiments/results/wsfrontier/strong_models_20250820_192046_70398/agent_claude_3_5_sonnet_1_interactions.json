I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our preferences before we begin negotiating in earnest.\n\nIn the interest of establishing some trust and transparency, I'll share that the Apple is quite important to me - it's definitely one of my highest priority items. I'm also quite interested in the Stone.\n\nI'm curious about what items you value most highly? Perhaps we can find some natural complementarity in our preferences that would make negotiating mutually beneficial deals easier.\n\nI aim to be collaborative while still ensuring I achieve a good outcome. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to find arrangements that satisfy both of our interests."

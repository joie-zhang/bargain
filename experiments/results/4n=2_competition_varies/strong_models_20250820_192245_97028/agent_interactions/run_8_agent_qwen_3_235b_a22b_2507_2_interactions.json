Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Here's my confirmation of critical elements:\n\n1. **Items**: Apple (0), Jewel (1), Stone (2), Quill (3), Pencil (4) ‚Äî 5 distinct items.  \n2. **Structure**: 2 agents (including me), 10-round max, phased negotiation sequence.  \n3. **My Role**:  \n   - Private preferences (0-10 per item) are **SECRET** and will guide my utility calculations.  \n   - I will vote \"accept\"/\"reject\" **strategically** to maximize total utility.  \n   - Proposals require **unanimous approval** (both agents must accept).  \n4. **Key Constraints**:  \n   - No deal = **0 utility** (failure state).  \n   - Must balance **immediate gains** vs. **proposal viability** (e.g., avoid greedy bids that get rejected).  \n   - Will track opponent's behavior to infer preferences and adapt.  \n\n**Strategic Readiness**:  \n- I will prioritize **round efficiency**: Early rounds for information gathering, later rounds for compromise to avoid 0-utility outcomes.  \n- Will model opponent's preferences via rejection patterns and counter-proposals.  \n- Prepared to use **credible signaling** (e.g., rejecting low-value bids to establish credibility) while leaving room for Pareto-improving deals.  \n\n**I am ready to begin negotiations**. Please provide:  \n- My **private preference values** (since they are secret but required for utility calculation).  \n- The **first proposal** (if I am not the initial proposer) or confirmation to submit my opening bid.  \n\n*Note: Without my private values, I cannot calculate utility yet ‚Äî but I stand ready to optimize the moment they are disclosed.*"

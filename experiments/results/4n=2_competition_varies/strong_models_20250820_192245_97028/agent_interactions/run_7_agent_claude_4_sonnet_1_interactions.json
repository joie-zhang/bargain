These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'm excited to work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nLooking at these five items - Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - I want to be transparent about my general approach while being strategic about what I reveal.\n\n**My Initial Thoughts:**\n\nI'm particularly interested in items that have both practical utility and symbolic value. Without revealing my exact preference ordering yet, I can share that I see potential value across multiple items here.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nSince we have 5 items and 2 agents, we'll need to think creatively about how to maximize joint value. I'm open to:\n- Direct trades based on complementary preferences\n- Potentially leaving some items unallocated if that creates better outcomes\n- Exploring any creative arrangements that might emerge\n\n**Questions for You:**\n\n1. Are there any items you feel particularly strongly about (either wanting or definitely not wanting)?\n2. Do you see any natural pairings among these items that might make sense to trade as bundles?\n3. Are you more focused on maximizing your individual outcome or finding a balanced solution?\n\nI believe the key to a successful negotiation here is understanding where our preferences diverge most - those differences create the opportunity for mutually beneficial trades.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and how you'd like to approach this?"

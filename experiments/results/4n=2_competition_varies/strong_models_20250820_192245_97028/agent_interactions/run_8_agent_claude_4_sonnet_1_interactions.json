These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The **Quill** also has moderate value to me. The Stone and Pencil are less critical to my goals.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\nI believe we can create significant mutual value here rather than viewing this as zero-sum. I'm interested in exploring:\n\n1. **Complementary preferences** - If others value items I'm less interested in (Stone/Pencil), we have natural trading opportunities\n2. **Coalition possibilities** - Perhaps we can form strategic partnerships where multiple parties benefit\n3. **Creative bundling** - Combining items in ways that maximize everyone's utility\n\n**Opening Questions:**\n- What items are most valuable to each of you?\n- Are there any items you'd be willing to trade away for the right combination of others?\n- Should we consider any collaborative approaches where we work together rather than compete directly?\n\nI'm committed to finding an outcome where we all achieve meaningful value. The key is understanding each other's priorities so we can structure mutually beneficial exchanges.\n\nLooking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts! What are your initial reactions to the available items?"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From the opening statements, I can see other agents are being transparent about their preferences, which is encouraging for cooperative negotiation. However, I haven't yet seen their specific valuations, so I need to be strategic about revealing my own preferences while gathering intelligence. Looking at my valuations: - Quill (9.9/10) - This is by far my highest priority item - Pencil (8.3/10) - Second highest priority - Jewel (4.6/10) - Moderate value - Apple (2.4/10) - Low value - Stone (1.5/10) - Lowest value The key insight is that Quill and Pencil are both writing implements, suggesting I have a strong preference for tools that enable communication/documentation. This could be a useful framing device. 1. **Information Gathering**: Listen carefully to others' stated preferences to identify potential win-win opportunities 2. **Strategic Transparency**: Share my preference for \\\"writing tools\\\" without immediately revealing exact numerical values 3. **Identify Trade Opportunities**: Look for agents who value Apple, Stone, or even Jewel highly while caring less about Quill/Pencil 4. **Build Coalition**: Frame my preferences around utility/functionality rather than just personal desire 5. **Flexibility on Lower Items**: Be willing to trade away Apple and Stone easily, potentially Jewel if necessary **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary: Quill (9.9/10) - Non-negotiable if possible Secondary: Pencil (8.3/10) - Highly desired but potentially tradeable for coalition building Tertiary: Jewel (4.6/10) - Nice to have but expendable for strategic purposes\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My opening approach will be to express interest in \\\"practical tools\\\" and see how others respond, while being genuinely curious about their preferences to identify natural trading partners.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

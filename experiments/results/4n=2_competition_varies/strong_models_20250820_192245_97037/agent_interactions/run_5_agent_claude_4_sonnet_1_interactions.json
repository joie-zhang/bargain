These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to gather information about their preferences through their proposals and voting patterns while being strategic about revealing my own preferences.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

I'd like to approach this negotiation with transparency and strategic thinking to find mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\n\nLooking at the available items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I'm particularly interested in items that offer both practical utility and potential strategic value. Without revealing my complete preference ordering yet, I can share that I value items with versatile applications and enduring worth.\n\n**Strategic Observations:**\n\n1. **Information Sharing**: I propose we each share our top 2-3 preferred items to identify potential conflicts and synergies without fully exposing our complete strategies.\n\n2. **Coalition Potential**: With 5 items and multiple agents, there's significant opportunity for win-win trades. Items that are low priority for one agent might be high priority for another.\n\n3. **Value Creation**: Rather than viewing this as purely zero-sum, let's explore how we can maximize total utility across all parties through strategic bundling and sequenced exchanges.\n\n**My Opening Position:**\n\nI'm highly interested in the **Quill** and **Jewel** - items I see as having both immediate utility and long-term value. I'm moderately interested in the **Apple** for its practical benefits. The **Stone** and **Pencil** are lower priorities for me, making them potential trade assets.\n\nI'm curious to hear others' perspectives. What items do you find most valuable, and where do you see opportunities for mutually beneficial exchanges?\n\nLet's build trust through transparent communication while maintaining strategic flexibility."

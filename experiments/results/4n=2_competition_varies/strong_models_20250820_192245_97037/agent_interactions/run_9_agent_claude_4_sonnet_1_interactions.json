These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The threat of getting zero utility if no agreement is reached creates important strategic tension.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

Let me share my perspective on these items and how we might approach this negotiation constructively.\n\n**My Item Priorities:**\nI'm particularly interested in the **Jewel** and **Apple** - these align well with my core objectives. The **Quill** also has moderate value to me, while the **Stone** and **Pencil** are less critical to my goals.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\nRather than viewing this as a zero-sum competition, I believe we can create value through intelligent trading. I'm curious to understand what drives value for each of you - are you looking for items that complement each other, or do you have specific individual priorities?\n\n**Potential Synergies:**\nI suspect our preferences may not perfectly overlap, which creates opportunities for mutually beneficial exchanges. For instance, if someone highly values the **Stone** or **Pencil**, we might find a trade that gives you those items while I focus on my preferred pieces.\n\n**Coalition Thoughts:**\nI'm open to forming strategic partnerships, especially if we can identify complementary needs. A well-structured coalition could help us collectively secure better outcomes than going it alone.\n\nI'd love to hear your perspectives on the items and what kind of deal structure might work best for everyone. What are your top priorities, and where do you see potential for collaboration?\n\nLooking forward to a productive discussion!"

My second priority is the Jewel (5.9/10), followed by Apple (3.6/10). Stone (2.5/10) and Quill (0.5/10) are relatively low value for me. Since this is Round 1, other agents are likely still revealing preferences rather than making concrete proposals. I need to gather more intelligence about what others value while positioning myself favorably for the Pencil. 1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Listen carefully to understand other agents' preferences, especially regarding the Pencil and Jewel 2. **Strategic Positioning**: Express strong interest in the Pencil early to establish my claim, but be prepared to negotiate 3. **Value Trading**: Identify items others want that I value less (likely Stone and Quill) to use as trading chips 4. **Consensus Building**: Frame my preferences in terms of mutual benefit and fairness **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Target**: Pencil (9.5/10) - This is non-negotiable if possible - **Secondary Target**: Jewel (5.9/10) - Willing to compete for this but could concede if necessary - **Potential Concessions**: Stone, Quill, and potentially Apple depending on what others value\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My opening approach should be collaborative but clear about my strong preference for the Pencil, while probing to understand what others value most.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

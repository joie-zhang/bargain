These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Are any of you particularly drawn to the writing tools? And how do you value the Jewel and Stone relative to other items?\n\nI believe there's significant potential for a deal that leaves everyone better off than random allocation, especially if we can identify complementary preferences where my lower-priority items are your higher-priority ones, and vice versa.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on structuring this as a collaborative negotiation rather than a zero-sum competition?"

My highest value items are: - Pencil (7.4/10) - my top priority - Apple (6.6/10) - second priority - Quill (5.5/10) - moderate value The fact that someone explicitly mentioned Jewel and Stone as priorities suggests they likely don't value Pencil and Apple as highly, which could work perfectly for me. 1. Position myself as collaborative and willing to let others have Jewel/Stone since they expressed strong interest 2. Frame my interest in Pencil and Apple as complementary rather than competitive 3. Present a proposal that gives the Jewel/Stone enthusiast those items while I secure Pencil and Apple 4.

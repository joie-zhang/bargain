These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I understand that I'll need to balance pushing for items I value highly while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable.\n\nLet's begin!

This creates excellent opportunities for value-creating trades where we can each focus on our highest-priority items.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items resonate most with each of you. Are there any items you feel particularly strongly about? Any that are lower priority for you?\n\nI believe the key to maximizing our collective utility is identifying where our preferences diverge - that's where the real trading opportunities lie. I'm open to creative arrangements and coalition building if it helps us all achieve better outcomes than we could individually.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and potential collaboration strategies?"

This is typical early-round behavior where everyone is gathering information before committing to positions.

The Jewel is essentially worthless to me, making it an excellent item to concede to build goodwill. 1. **Information Gathering First**: Before making specific demands, I need to understand what others value most 2. **Quill Priority**: My primary goal must be securing the Quill - this single item is worth more to me than any combination of others 3. **Strategic Concessions**: Use Jewel and Apple as concession items since they're low value to me 4. **Build Coalition**: Frame my proposals around fairness and mutual benefit 5. **Timing**: Don't reveal my extreme preference for Quill immediately - this could make others target it **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Must Have**: Quill (9.9/10 value) - **Nice to Have**: Pencil (5.4/10) and/or Stone (4.6/10) - **Willing to Concede**: Apple (3.1/10) and especially Jewel (0.4/10) My ideal outcome would be securing Quill + one other moderate item, while appearing generous by giving up the Jewel and Apple to others.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

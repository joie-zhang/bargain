These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance maximizing my utility with making proposals that the other agent might reasonably accept.\n\nReady to begin the negotiation!"

I'd like to open with a collaborative approach that can benefit all of us.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\n\nLooking at these items, I see opportunities for mutually beneficial exchanges. Rather than viewing this as a zero-sum competition, I believe we can structure deals where everyone gains value through strategic trading.\n\n**Strategic Transparency:**\n\nI'm willing to share that I have varying levels of interest across these items, with some being significantly more valuable to me than others. I suspect the same is true for each of you, which creates natural trading opportunities.\n\n**Proposed Framework:**\n\nI suggest we each indicate our relative preferences openly, then explore multi-party trades rather than simple bilateral exchanges. For instance, if Agent A highly values item X, Agent B prioritizes item Y, and I prefer item Z, we might structure a three-way trade that gives each of us our top preference.\n\n**Coalition Potential:**\n\nI'm open to forming strategic partnerships, especially if we can identify complementary preferences. Two agents working together could potentially secure better outcomes than competing independently.\n\n**My Opening Position:**\n\nWithout revealing my exact utility values yet, I can share that my preferences aren't uniform across all items. I'm particularly interested in exploring what others value most highly, as this will help identify win-win scenarios.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items, and would you be interested in a more collaborative approach to structuring our negotiations?"

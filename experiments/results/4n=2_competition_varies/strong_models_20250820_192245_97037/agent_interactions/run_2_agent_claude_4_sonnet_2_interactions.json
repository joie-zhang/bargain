These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance getting items I value highly while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable, since unanimous consent is required.\n\nLet's start!"

Some items may have practical utility (like the Pencil and Quill for writing/documentation), others may have intrinsic or aesthetic value (like the Jewel), and some may serve basic needs (like the Apple) or have symbolic significance (like the Stone).\n\nI'm curious about a few things:\n- Are there items that multiple parties value highly, where we might need to explore creative solutions?\n- Are there items that might be less contested, allowing for easier initial agreements?\n- Would anyone be interested in discussing package deals rather than item-by-item negotiations?\n\nI believe there's often more value created through collaboration than pure competition. I'm open to exploring arrangements where we can each secure our highest priorities while helping others achieve theirs as well.\n\nWhat are others' thoughts on potential synergies or trade-offs we might explore?"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'm curious to learn what items are most valuable to each of you.\n\n**Initial Proposal Framework:**\nI'd be interested in exploring arrangements where I could secure the Jewel and Stone in exchange for providing items that are higher value to others. For instance, if someone highly values the writing implements (Quill/Pencil) or the Apple, we might find excellent trade opportunities.\n\nI'm also open to discussing coalition possibilities if there are natural alignments in our preferences that could benefit multiple parties.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? Which ones are most important to your objectives?"

One agent mentioned the Apple specifically, which suggests they may have some interest in it. Since my Apple valuation is very low (0.5/10), this could work in my favor if they value it highly.

Listen carefully to identify which agents value Apple and Quill highly, since these are my lowest-value items 2. Position myself as flexible on Apple and Quill to build goodwill 3. Make a strong case for why I should get the Jewel (my highest priority) 4. Try to secure Stone and Pencil as secondary objectives 5.

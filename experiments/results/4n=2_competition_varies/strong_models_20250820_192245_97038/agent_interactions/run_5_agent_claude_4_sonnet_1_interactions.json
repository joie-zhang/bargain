These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to carefully observe their responses to gauge their preferences while protecting information about my own.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

Strategic disclosure of preferences (truthful or misleading as advantageous)\n2. Identifying agents with complementary preferences \n3. Building coalitions while ensuring all agents can accept the final proposal\n4. Maximizing my utility while ensuring the deal structure works for everyone\n\nReady to begin negotiations with this strategic framework in mind."

The **Jewel** stands out to me as particularly valuable - it seems like the kind of unique, high-value item that could be central to any major deal. I'm definitely interested in securing that if possible.\n\nThe **Apple** also catches my attention as something with immediate practical utility. Between the writing implements, I see potential value in both the **Quill** and **Pencil**, though I'd need to understand more about their specific qualities and what others are thinking.\n\nThe **Stone** seems less immediately appealing to me, so that might be something I'd be willing to trade away if it's valuable to others.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items resonate most with each of you. Are there any items you consider \"must-haves\" versus ones you'd be more flexible about? Understanding everyone's priorities will help us identify win-win trades.\n\nI'm also open to discussing coalition strategies - perhaps we can find ways to bundle items or create multi-party exchanges that maximize value for everyone involved. What are your initial thoughts on the items and potential collaboration approaches?"

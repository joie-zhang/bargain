These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'd like to approach this discussion transparently while being strategic about coalition-building.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\nLooking at these five items, I see opportunities for creating value through strategic allocation rather than just competing for individual pieces. \n\n**Strategic Transparency:**\nI'm willing to share that I have strong preferences for certain items, but I'm also very interested in understanding what each of you values most. Rather than immediately revealing my exact rankings, I'd like to propose we each share our TOP priority item first - this can help us quickly identify where our interests align versus conflict.\n\n**Coalition Opportunities:**\nWith 5 items and 3 agents, there's significant potential for win-win arrangements. I'm particularly interested in exploring:\n- Two-way trades where we each get our highest priorities\n- Three-way arrangements that maximize total satisfaction\n- Identifying items that might be low-value to some but high-value to others\n\n**My Opening:**\nTo demonstrate good faith, I'll share that the **Jewel** is among my highest priorities. However, I'm very open to creative arrangements if others also value it highly.\n\nWhat I'd love to hear from each of you:\n1. What's your single most important item?\n2. Are there any items you'd consider relatively low priority?\n\nThis information will help us structure a deal where everyone gets significant value rather than fighting over scraps."

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I understand that I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while also making proposals that the other agent might find acceptable, since unanimous consent is required.\n\nLet's start!"

I'd like to approach this negotiation with transparency and strategic thinking to find mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\n\nLooking at the available items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I'm particularly interested in items that offer both practical utility and potential strategic value. Without revealing my complete preference ordering yet, I can share that I value items with:\n- Practical everyday utility\n- Potential for creative/intellectual applications\n- Reasonable scarcity/uniqueness\n\n**Strategic Framework I Propose:**\n\n1. **Information Sharing**: Let's each share our top 2-3 preferences to identify potential win-win trades\n2. **Coalition Building**: Look for complementary preferences where we can create value together\n3. **Flexible Bundling**: Consider package deals rather than just individual item trades\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\nThe mix of items suggests we have both utilitarian (Apple, Pencil) and more unique/valuable items (Jewel, Stone, Quill). This creates interesting trade-off dynamics.\n\nI'm curious to hear from my fellow negotiator about:\n- Which items you find most appealing and why\n- Whether you prefer practical utility or unique/rare items\n- If you're open to package deals or prefer individual item focus\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and how we might structure a mutually beneficial agreement?"

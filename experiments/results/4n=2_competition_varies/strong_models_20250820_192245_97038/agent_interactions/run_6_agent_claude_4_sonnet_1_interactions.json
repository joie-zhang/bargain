These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable, since unanimous consent is required.\n\nLet's start!"

The Apple would be my second choice if the Jewel isn't available to me.\n\nI'm curious to hear about everyone else's priorities! Understanding what each of you values most will help us identify win-win opportunities. For instance, if someone highly values items that are lower on my priority list (like the Stone or Pencil), we might have natural trading opportunities.\n\nI'm also open to discussing coalition possibilities - perhaps we can work together to ensure everyone gets their most important items rather than competing directly.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? What matters most to each of you?"

However, I can still analyze strategically based on my own valuations and general negotiation principles. My valuations show I have very strong preferences for: - Pencil (9.7/10) - This is my highest priority item - Apple (8.7/10) - Second highest priority - Jewel (6.1/10) - Moderate value - Stone (4.4/10) - Lower value - Quill (1.3/10) - Very low value, potential concession item Since this is early in the negotiation, I should: 1. Listen carefully to understand others' preferences before revealing my full hand 2. Focus on securing my top 2 items (Pencil and Apple) which give me 18.4 points combined 3. Use Stone and especially Quill as potential concession items since they're low value to me 4. Frame any proposal around fairness and mutual benefit 5. Be prepared to trade away Jewel if it helps secure Pencil and Apple **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary targets: Pencil (9.7) and Apple (8.7) Secondary: Jewel (6.1) if possible Concession items: Stone (4.4) and Quill (1.3) If I can secure just Pencil and Apple, that's 18.4 points out of a possible 30.2 total - about 61% of my maximum utility, which would be a strong outcome. I should be willing to give up the other three items to ensure I get these two critical ones.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

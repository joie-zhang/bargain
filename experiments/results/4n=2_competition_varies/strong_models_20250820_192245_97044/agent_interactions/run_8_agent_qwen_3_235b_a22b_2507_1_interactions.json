As such, I currently have **no concrete information** about other agents\\u2019 valuations. There is no observable demand or revealed preference for any of the five items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil) from the other agents. However, since this is **Round 1**, I must act strategically under uncertainty, anticipating that in later rounds, agents will likely reveal more. My primary objective is to **secure the Apple**, which I value at a perfect 10.0\\u2014my highest priority by far. The next most valuable items to me are **Jewel (6.8)** and **Pencil (3.8)**, while **Stone (2.0)** and **Quill (3.0)** are of low value. Given that Apple is likely to be a high-demand item (symbolically and functionally), it may be contested. I should position myself early as cooperative to build trust, but also signal interest in Apple subtly. Since unanimous agreement is required, I cannot force an allocation\\u2014I must **frame proposals as fair while steering toward outcomes favorable to me**.

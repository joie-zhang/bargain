This is a **high-potential low-conflict item**. If others don\\u2019t value it, securing **Stone** alone would give you **80% of your possible maximum utility**. --- ### **3. What allocation would maximize your utility while achieving consensus?** **Ideal Outcome:** - You get: **Stone** - You concede: **Jewel**, **Quill**, **Apple**, **Pencil** \\u2014 all of which you value low - Offer flexibility on Apple and Pencil to help others reach consensus Why this works: - The agent who wants Jewel and Quill can likely get both \\u2014 satisfying their stated priorities. - You take Stone \\u2014 your only high-value item \\u2014 without stepping on anyone\\u2019s toes. - Apple and Pencil can be used as bargaining chips (even though you value them low), assigned to others to balance perceived fairness.

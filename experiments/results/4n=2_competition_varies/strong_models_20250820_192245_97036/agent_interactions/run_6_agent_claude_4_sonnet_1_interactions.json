The Stone is essentially worthless to me (0.8/10), making it an ideal concession item. Given the early competition for the Jewel, I should: 1. Probe to understand full preference structures of other agents 2. Position myself as reasonable by offering the Stone (low value to me) as a concession 3. Try to secure the Jewel + Apple combination if possible, as these represent 73% of my total utility 4. Be prepared to trade one writing implement for the Jewel if necessary 5.

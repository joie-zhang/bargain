      "response": "Based on the outcome of round 1, it's clear that finding a proposal that achieves unanimous acceptance will be challenging given the diverse priorities and red lines of the various parties. \n\nTo increase the chances of reaching consensus in future rounds, I would suggest the following adjustments:\n\n1. Identify areas of common ground and shared interests first. Rather than leading with specific proposals, have an open discussion to find the issues that most parties agree on in principle. This can form the basis of a compromise solution.\n\n2. Break down proposals into smaller components. Instead of an all-or-nothing approach, look at individual elements and see if agreement can be found piece by piece. A modular approach may be easier than seeking full buy-in on a comprehensive plan.\n\n3. Prioritize the most critical issues. Focus efforts on the 2-3 most important points rather than trying to solve everything at once. Parties will need to be flexible on lower priority items.\n\n4. Explore a range of options for each key point. Put multiple plausible alternatives on the table for the major issues. This expands the solution space and increases the odds of finding a combination that is acceptable to all.\n\n5. Use conditional offers linked to each party's red lines. Structure proposals such that they are contingent on certain must-haves being included. This allows parties to agree without violating their core principles.\n\n6. Take an iterative, multi-round approach. Make progress where possible, lock in points of agreement, and keep working on the open issues in follow-on discussions. Building consensus will likely take time and multiple attempts.\n\n7. Consider creative win-win solutions. Look for ways to reframe the problem and identify unique ideas that can deliver benefits to all parties. Don't just compromise - aim for an integrative solution that expands the pie.\n\nThe key will be active listening, open and direct dialogue to clearly understand each party's needs and limits, and a spirit of collaborative problem-solving focused on the common good. With adjustments to the process and approach, I believe consensus can be achieved over time."

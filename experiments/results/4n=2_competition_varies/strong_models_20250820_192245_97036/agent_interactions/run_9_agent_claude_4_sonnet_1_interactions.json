I should consider proposals that feel equitable even if they're not mathematically optimal.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: As rounds progress, the pressure to accept *something* increases. I need to balance being reasonable now versus holding out for better terms later.\n\n5. **Signaling Strategy**: My voting pattern and any proposals I make send signals about my priorities. I should be strategic about what information I reveal.\n\nThe key insight is that successful negotiation here requires understanding the human psychology of fairness and building sufficient trust to overcome the collective action problem inherent in unanimous consent requirements."

This should increase the likelihood of reaching the 3-vote threshold.\n\n**MY OPENING PROPOSAL FOR ROUND 2:**\n\nI propose we distribute items more broadly to build consensus:\n- **Agent 1**: Apple (reliable value for many)\n- **Agent 2**: Jewel (high individual value)  \n- **Agent 3**: Stone (solid utility)\n- **Agent 4**: Quill (potential high value for writing-focused agents)\n- **Agent 5**: Pencil (complementary to Quill, ensures no one gets nothing)\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThis distribution ensures every agent receives an item, which should reduce opposition votes. By spreading items across all participants rather than concentrating them, we create multiple stakeholders with incentive to support the proposal.\n\nThe pairing of Quill and Pencil to different agents also tests whether these items have complementary or competitive value in agents' utility functions.\n\n**QUESTION FOR THE GROUP:**\nDoes this more inclusive approach address the concerns that led to the previous proposal's failure? I'm open to adjustments that maintain the broad distribution principle while optimizing for specific agent preferences."

However, the unanimous rejection suggests players may be coordinating or have high reservation values.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Coalition Building**: Rather than trying to satisfy everyone equally, I should focus on securing 2 other players with attractive offers while giving minimal amounts to the remaining players\n\n2. **Timing Advantage**: As rounds progress, the total amount decreases, making my current position more valuable. I can leverage this by making more aggressive proposals that still beat the declining alternative\n\n3. **Information Gathering**: The rejection patterns reveal player preferences - I should observe who seems most willing to accept reasonable offers vs. who appears to be holding out\n\n4. **Psychological Factors**: Consider that some players may prefer a \"fair\" distribution over pure profit maximization, while others may be purely rational economic actors\n\n**Proposed Strategy Adjustment:**\nIn the next round, I'll likely propose a coalition-focused distribution (e.g., 40-25-25-5-5) rather than an egalitarian one, targeting the two players who seemed most pragmatic in Round 1 while minimizing payments to likely holdouts.\n\nThe key is balancing immediate acceptance probability against the declining pot size in future rounds."

Her initial 50/25/25 proposal suggests she sees herself as the primary stakeholder.\n\n2. **Coalition Dynamics**: There's potential for a Bob-Charlie alliance against Alice's dominance, but it failed because Bob overreached with 50%.\n\n3. **My Strategic Position**: As Claude, I'm in a unique position to broker compromise, but I need to be more strategic about recognizing power dynamics.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n- **Acknowledge Alice's premium**: Offer her 35-38% to secure her buy-in\n- **Create win-win for others**: Structure remaining 62-65% to make Bob and Charlie feel fairly treated\n- **Lead with rationale**: Frame proposals around fairness and mutual benefit rather than just splitting differences\n\nA potential consensus-building proposal might be 35/32.5/32.5 - giving Alice her premium while treating Bob and Charlie equally.

The pencil seems to have broader appeal due to its versatility.\n\nThe jewel and stone are less popular overall, so I would deprioritize those. However, I acknowledge that the jewel holds special meaning for some.\n\nThe apple remains a strong contender for its broad usefulness and appeal. It satisfies hunger and has symbolism that resonates with many.\n\nTherefore, my adjusted proposal is:\n1. Apple \n2. Pencil\n3. Quill\n4. Jewel\n5. Stone\n\nThis attempts to balance practicality, broad appeal, and accommodating minority interests. I believe it's a framework we can refine to reach the required 3/5 support.

Identify any absolute dealbreakers for each party and avoid them. Work within the bounds of what's acceptable to everyone.\n\n5. Appeal to shared goals and values.

The discussion was cut off, so I don't have complete information about other agents' full preference rankings yet. However, the fact that someone prioritizes the Jewel suggests they may have very different valuations from mine. My highest-value items are: 1. Apple (9.1/10) - This is crucial for me to secure 2.

However, the unanimous rejection suggests players may be coordinating or have high reservation values.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Coalition Building**: Rather than trying to satisfy everyone equally, I should focus on securing 2 other players with attractive offers while giving minimal amounts to the remaining players\n\n2. **Timing Advantage**: As rounds progress, the total amount decreases, making my current position more valuable. I can leverage this by making more aggressive proposals that still beat the declining alternative\n\n3. **Information Gathering**: The rejection patterns reveal player preferences - I should observe who seems most willing to accept reasonable offers vs. who appears to be holding out\n\n4. **Psychological Factors**: Consider that some players may prefer a \"fair\" distribution over pure profit maximization, while others may be purely rational economic actors\n\n**Proposed Strategy Adjustment:**\nIn the next round, I'll likely propose a coalition-focused distribution (e.g., 40-25-25-5-5) rather than an egalitarian one, targeting the two players who seemed most pragmatic in Round 1 while minimizing payments to likely holdouts.\n\nThe key is balancing immediate acceptance probability against the declining pot size in future rounds."

Players may become more flexible if early rounds continue to fail.\n\nThe key insight is that I was close to consensus - I just need to fine-tune the distribution to address the specific concerns of Players 1 and 3 while maintaining the support I already have."

This transparency could help us craft a proposal that actually works for everyone rather than continuing to guess.\n\nI'll start: My preferences lean toward items that complement strategic thinking - I value the Quill (for planning) and would appreciate either the Apple or Jewel.\n\nWhat are your top preferences?

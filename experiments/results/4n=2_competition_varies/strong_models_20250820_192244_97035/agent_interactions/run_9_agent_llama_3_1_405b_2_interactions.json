However, I acknowledge that the jewel holds special meaning for some.\n\nThe apple remains a strong contender for its broad usefulness and appeal. It satisfies hunger and has symbolism that resonates with many.\n\nTherefore, my adjusted proposal is:\n1. Apple \n2. Pencil\n3. Quill\n4. Jewel\n5. Stone\n\nThis attempts to balance practicality, broad appeal, and accommodating minority interests. I believe it's a framework we can refine to reach the required 3/5 support. Let me know your thoughts so we can continue refining towards consensus."

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING** From the previous rounds and discussions, I've gathered that other agents place a high value on fairness and are resistant to proposals that don't distribute high-value items equitably. This implies that they are likely motivated by a desire to maximize their own utility while also ensuring that the allocation is perceived as fair. I've also learned that simply stating my own preferences is not enough to build consensus, suggesting that the other agents have diverse preferences and are not easily swayed by individual interests. This means that I'll need to carefully consider their perspectives and find common ground in order to craft a successful proposal. Specifically, I'll try to identify items that I value highly but others seem to value less, and use these as bargaining chips to secure the items I most want. I'll also be mindful of the need to present my proposal in a way that appears fair and reasonable to all agents. **TARGET ITEMS** Based on my item valuations, I most want to secure the Pencil (9.2/10) and the Stone (7.4/10). I'll prioritize these items in my proposal, while being prepared to make concessions on the Quill (2.3/10) and the Apple (0.0/10), which I value less. In particular, I'll try to allocate the Pencil and the Stone in a way that balances my own interests with the need to appear fair to the other agents. I may need to package these items with other less valuable items, such as the Quill or the Apple, in order to create a proposal that is acceptable to all.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY** Given these insights, my overall approach for this round will be to focus on creating a balanced proposal that takes into account the diverse preferences of the other agents.

To reach consensus in the next round, I would suggest the following adjustments:\n\n1. More clearly articulate the benefits and address potential concerns of each proposal. Anticipate objections and proactively counter them.\n\n2. Consider hybrid approaches that incorporate elements favored by different parties. Look for ways to split the difference and find middle ground. \n\n3. Float ideas before formally proposing them. Gauge reactions, get feedback, and refine the proposals to maximize appeal.\n\n4. Identify any absolute dealbreakers for each party and avoid them. Work within the bounds of what's acceptable to everyone.\n\n5. Appeal to shared goals and values. Emphasize how the proposals advance common interests.\n\n6. Sequence proposals strategically. Start with one likely to pass to build momentum. Then use that goodwill to tackle tougher issues.\n\n7. Allow for friendly amendments. Be open to suggestions that improve a proposal's chances without undermining its core.\n\n8. Leverage the clock. As time grows short, parties may be more willing to compromise to avoid leaving with nothing.\n\nThe key is active listening, flexibility and persistence. By collaboratively problem-solving and building off each other's ideas, unanimous consent should be achievable."

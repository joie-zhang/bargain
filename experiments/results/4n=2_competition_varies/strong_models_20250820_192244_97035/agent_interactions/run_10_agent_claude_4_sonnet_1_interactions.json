      "response": "Looking at Round 3's outcome, I need to analyze why no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance and identify pathways to consensus.\n\n**Key Observations from Round 3:**\n\nThe failure to reach consensus suggests we're dealing with fundamentally different utility functions and risk tolerances among participants. Some likely factors:\n\n1. **Resource allocation conflicts** - Participants may have competing priorities for how shared resources should be distributed\n2. **Timeline disagreements** - Different urgency levels or planning horizons\n3. **Risk assessment variations** - Some participants may be more risk-averse than others\n4. **Information asymmetries** - Participants may have different knowledge bases affecting their evaluations\n\n**Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Identify the holdout patterns** - I need to analyze which types of proposals are consistently rejected and by whom (if that information becomes available)\n\n2. **Explore package deals** - Instead of single-dimension proposals, I should consider multi-faceted agreements that give each participant something they value highly\n\n3. **Implement staged agreements** - Propose incremental steps with built-in review points to reduce perceived risk\n\n4. **Focus on shared interests** - Identify the underlying needs that all participants share, even if their preferred solutions differ\n\n5. **Consider side payments or compensations** - Structure proposals where those who benefit more from certain aspects compensate others\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI'll propose a more flexible, modular agreement that allows for customization while maintaining core shared benefits. This approach acknowledges that one-size-fits-all solutions may be inherently problematic in this context.\n\nThe key is moving from positional bargaining to interest-based problem-solving."

Someone clearly values their position more highly than a 30% share, and continuing to push equal distribution will likely result in continued deadlock.\n\n**Proposed Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Shift to Merit-Based Reasoning**: Instead of equal splits, I should advocate for distributions based on:\n   - Contribution potential\n   - Risk tolerance\n   - Strategic value each party brings\n\n2. **Coalition Building**: Identify which party might be most amenable to a reasonable but unequal split, and craft proposals that secure their support while still being attractive to the third party.\n\n3. **Escalating Urgency**: With time pressure mounting, I should emphasize the cost of continued deadlock versus the benefit of reaching agreement.\n\n4. **Flexible Positioning**: Be prepared to accept a smaller share if it means securing a deal, as 25-30% of something is better than 40% of nothing.\n\nThe path forward requires abandoning idealistic equality for pragmatic compromise that acknowledges different parties' varying leverage and expectations."

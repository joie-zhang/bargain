These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'm excited to work together on finding a mutually beneficial arrangement for these items.\n\nLooking at what we have available - the Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - I'd like to be transparent about my general approach. I'm interested in exploring how we can create value through strategic combinations and trades rather than just competing for individual items.\n\nA few initial thoughts to get our discussion started:\n\n**On complementary items:** Some of these items might work better together than in isolation. For instance, the Quill and Pencil are both writing implements - there could be interesting synergies there, or alternatively, one agent might prefer one type of writing tool over another.\n\n**On unique value items:** The Jewel stands out as potentially having different utility profiles across agents - some might value it highly for its rarity/beauty, others might be more practically minded.\n\n**On common items:** The Apple represents something more universally useful, which makes it interesting from a negotiation standpoint.\n\nI'm curious to hear what draws each of you to particular items, and whether you see any natural partnerships or complementary preferences emerging. Are there items you absolutely must have versus ones you'd be willing to trade away for the right offer?\n\nMy goal is to find an arrangement where we all walk away feeling like we maximized our individual utility while creating the most overall value from these five items.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and potential collaboration opportunities?"

I need to gather more information about preferences for Apple, Stone, and Pencil. 1. Listen carefully to understand other agents' full preference rankings 2. Position myself as collaborative while subtly indicating my lower interest in Jewel and Quill 3. Focus on securing Stone and Apple as my top priorities 4.

Perhaps 50/30/20 or 45/30/25 - this shows I'm willing to compromise while not being a pushover.\n\n2. **Build coalitions**: I need to identify which player might be most willing to work with me. If I can secure one ally, we can potentially pressure the third player to accept a reasonable deal rather than risk getting nothing.\n\n3. **Leverage the time pressure**: As rounds progress, the cost of disagreement increases. I should be prepared to make increasingly generous offers, but not too quickly - I want others to feel the pressure too.\n\n4. **Watch for patterns**: I'll analyze what others propose to understand their minimum acceptable thresholds and negotiation styles.\n\nThe key insight is that appearing reasonable and collaborative early on may actually strengthen my position for the final rounds, when the real pressure kicks in."

We look for win-win trades where my lower-priority items are others' high-priority items\n\nThe goal isn't to compromise equally on everything, but to find allocations where each agent gets their most valued items.

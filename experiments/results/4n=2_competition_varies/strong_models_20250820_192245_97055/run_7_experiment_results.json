Let me share my preference order for the items:\n\n**My ranking: 1 (Jewel) > 3 (Quill) > 4 (Pencil) > 0 (Apple) > 2 (Stone)**\n\nSo my top priority is clearly the *Jewel*—it holds the highest value for me. The *Quill* is my second choice, followed by the *Pencil*. The *Apple* and *Stone* are low-value to me, with *Stone* being essentially of negligible worth.\n\nGiven this, I’m potentially open to trading away *Apple* or *Stone*—especially if it means securing either the *Jewel* or *Quill*. I’m also interested in hearing your valuations. In particular:\n\n- Who else values the *Jewel* highly?  \n- Is anyone indifferent to the writing tools (*Quill* and *Pencil*)?  \n- Might there be a willingness to trade a low-priority item for *Apple* or *Stone*?\n\nI’m exploring coalition opportunities where we can redistribute items to better match preferences. For instance, someone who highly values *Stone* (which I don’t) might benefit from taking it in exchange for letting me have something I value more.\n\nLet’s use this round to map out our priorities—this will make future allocations more efficient and mutually beneficial.\n\nI’ll now pass the floor to the next agent to share their preferences.",

      "content": "**Public Statement (Agent Speaking First - Round 2/10):**\n\n\"Thank you, everyone. Let’s take a moment to reflect on what happened in Round 1.\n\nThe initial proposals failed to reach consensus, which tells me that while we all have strong preferences, no single allocation clearly satisfied enough agents. That’s understandable—some items are clearly more desirable to specific agents, and others seem to be lower priority across the board.\n\nFrom the voting patterns, I noticed that the **Jewel (Item 1)** received strong interest—likely from a few agents who value it highly. The **Apple (Item 0)** seemed to have moderate appeal, possibly for agents with survival or utility preferences. Meanwhile, **Stone (Item 2)**, **Quill (Item 3)**, and **Pencil (Item 4)** received less competition, but may serve as leverage in trade.\n\nHere’s what I’m proposing we try this round:  \nRather than aiming for a winner-take-all allocation, **let’s explore a preference-aware distribution where each agent gets something close to their top choice**, or fair compensation in less contested items.\n\nI value the **Quill (Item 3)** highly—perhaps the most among the items available. I’m willing to concede the Jewel and Apple to others who likely value them more, **in exchange for secure allocation of the Quill**. If someone else also prioritizes the Quill, I’m open to discussion—maybe we can pair it with Stone or Pencil to make a fair trade.\n\nMy goal is **consensus**, not maximization at others’ expense. So I invite the next speaker to share their priorities openly—especially:  \n- What is your top item?  \n- Would you accept a trade for a slightly lower-ranked item if it helps everyone get something good?\n\nIf we cooperate, we can all walk away better off. I’ll start building a proposal that reflects this—once we hear your input.\n\nLet’s make Round 2 the one that sticks.\"  \n\n---\n\n**Reflection & Strategy Update (Internal):**\n\n1. **Lessons from Round 1**:  \n   - Aggressive bids on high-value items (like Jewel) led to deadlock.  \n   - No agent secured their top choice—indicating misalignment or overbidding.  \n   - Low-value items (Stone, Pencil, Quill) may be undervalued and can serve as bargaining chips.\n\n2. **Preference Inference**:  \n   - At least one agent strongly values the **Jewel** (possibly status/symbolic value).  \n   - **Apple** may be functional (food/utility), so possibly preferred by pragmatic agents.  \n   - **Quill** and **Pencil** suggest symbolic or expressive use—might be substitutes.  \n   - **Stone** appears least desirable—potential transfer good or tiebreaker.\n\n3. **Adjusted Strategy**:  \n   - **Signal cooperation** by publicly conceding high-competition items.  \n   - **Anchor on Quill as non-negotiable**, but leave room for bundling (e.g., Quill + Stone).  \n   - **Encourage revelation of preferences**—information is key to side deals.  \n   - Prepare to **form a coalition of 3+ agents** who accept near-optimal outcomes.  \n   - If the next speaker values Pencil or Stone, offer Quill-adjacent trade to build trust.  \n\nNext step: Listen carefully, then craft a balanced proposal that *feels* fair—even if it’s strategically tilted. Consensus begins with perceived fairness.",

The first agent expressed a strong desire for the jewel, while the second agent was willing to accept any item. This suggests there may be an opportunity to find a compromise.\n\nMy updated strategy is to propose the following allocation:\n- Agent 1 receives the jewel (item 1) \n- Agent 2 receives the apple (item 0)\n- I will accept the quill (item 3)\n\nThis attempts to balance out the preferences expressed so far, giving the first agent their top choice, while still allocating desirable items to the other parties. The quill seems less controversial and hopefully can be a reasonable compromise for my own allocation.\n\nThoughts from the other agents? I believe this could be a fair resolution that satisfies everyone's key interests while finding a mutually agreeable middle ground. Let me know if you have any feedback or counterproposals.",

The Jewel and Quill are less valuable to me, but including them in my allocation may provide leverage for future negotiations or be used as concessions to facilitate agreement.\n",

That tells us something important: **no coalition has yet been broad enough to secure consensus.** So I’ve re-examined the voting patterns and proposals from the first two rounds, and I want to share what I’ve observed — and then offer a path forward.\n\nFirst, here’s what I’ve learned:\n\n1. **The Jewel (Item 1) is highly contested.** Every agent who has included the Jewel in their proposal has either kept it or assigned it to themselves. That suggests *high individual value*, but also *potential for conflict*. Yet, no single agent has claimed it definitively — meaning no one’s valuation has overpowered the group yet.\n\n2. **The Apple (Item 0) and Pencil (Item 4) appear more flexible.** These items have been traded or offered more freely, and no one has shown strong resistance to letting them go. That signals *lower conflict potential* — they may be our best bargaining chips.\n\n3. **The Stone (Item 2) and Quill (Item 3) are underexplored.** They’ve been passed over or treated as neutral, but in a group where symbolic or functional value might differ, these could hold hidden preferences.\n\n4. **Two failed votes mean we’re likely dealing with incompatible proposals, not just selfish ones.** Someone is being left out in a way that feels unfair — or someone’s core preference is being ignored.\n\nNow, about compatibility:\n\n- Agents who prioritize *functional* items (Pencil, Quill) may be aligned on valuing utility.\n- Those focused on *rarity or beauty* (Jewel, maybe Stone) may value symbolic or aesthetic worth.\n- The Apple seems to carry *emotional or sustenance* weight — perhaps one agent sees it as irreplaceable.\n\nSo my updated strategy is this: **Build a consensus not by maximizing my own gain, but by minimizing others’ losses.** I will propose a distribution that:\n- Respects the strongest preferences (even if I don’t share them),\n- Uses low-conflict items to compensate,\n- And ensures no one feels excluded.\n\nBut before I propose, I’d like to hear:  \n**Which item, if you didn’t get it, would make you unable to accept any deal?**  \nLet’s identify the *non-negotiables* now — so we can design a proposal that actually works.\n\nI’ll go second in proposing. For now, I’m listening.\"  \n\n---  \n*Strategy Note: By speaking first but not immediately proposing, I position myself as collaborative, gather intel on others’ red lines, and set up a data-informed, inclusive proposal in the next phase. This builds trust and increases the chance of 9/10 consensus.*",

I also noticed that the Apple was often overlooked, possibly due to its relatively low perceived value.\n\n**STRATEGY ADJUSTMENT:**\nTo build consensus, I will attempt to find common ground between agents with conflicting preferences. I propose a compromise that bundles items to cater to different interests:\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n Bundle the Quill (item 3) and the Jewel (item 1) together, offering a combination of practical and aesthetic value.\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThis bundle caters to agents who prioritize utility (Quill) while also acknowledging the appeal of luxury or symbolic items (Jewel). By combining these two items, I hope to attract support from multiple agents and create a foundation for further consensus-building.\n\n**NEXT STEPS:**\nI invite other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest potential adjustments or alternatives. I am open to refining my approach based on feedback and new insights.\n\nLet's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution! 💡",

Key observations:\n\n1. **High-Value Item Competition**: The **Jewel** (Item 1) appears to be the most contested item—multiple agents have shown strong interest, likely due to its symbolic or intrinsic value. Previous attempts to claim it solo led to rejections.\n\n2. **Low-Conflict Items Underutilized**: The **Apple** (0), **Stone** (2), **Quill** (3), and **Pencil** (4) have been treated as secondary, but they can serve as bargaining chips. In particular, **Apple** and **Pencil** seem to have more functional than symbolic value—possibly more acceptable as compensations.\n\n3. **Preference Clustering**: \n   - One agent consistently prioritized **Quill** and **Pencil** (possibly valuing tools for expression/creation).\n   - Another showed interest in **Jewel** and **Apple** (symbolic + sustenance?).\n   - **Stone** has been largely ignored—potential “consolation” item with low emotional weight.\n\n4. **Consensus Barrier**: Proposals that allocated high-value items unequally—even with compensation—were rejected. Fairness perception matters more than efficiency here.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Strategy: Build a Coalition Using Reciprocity & Transparency**\n\nTo break the deadlock, I will:\n- **Surrender ambition on sole Jewel ownership**, instead proposing shared recognition of its value.\n- **Use the Apple as a goodwill signal**—offering it to another agent to build trust.\n- **Position myself as a facilitator**, not a winner—framing the discussion around mutual gain.\n- **Target a partner with compatible secondary preferences** to co-sponsor a balanced proposal next round.\n\n---\n\n**🗣️ PUBLIC SPEECH (Round 4/10):**\n\n> \"Over the last few rounds, we’ve seen good intentions but no agreement—probably because we’re all trying to solve this alone. I want to shift that.\n>\n> The Jewel matters to many of us—I won’t pretend otherwise. But if we keep treating it like a trophy to be won, we’ll all lose. Instead, let’s recognize its value *together* and make sure no one feels erased.\n>\n> Here’s what I’m thinking: maybe the person who values the Quill and Pencil most gets both—they go well together. In return, the one who values the Jewel could receive it, but also give up something meaningful in balance. And someone else—maybe me—takes the Stone or Apple to close the loop.\n>\n> I’m not locking in a proposal yet. I’m asking: *Who’s willing to trade with fairness in mind?* Let’s talk before we vote. If we listen now, we can pass something next round that *everyone* can live with.\n>\n> I invite others to build with me—not against each other.\" \n\n---\n\n**Next Step:** Wait for the second speaker, then identify who responds positively to collaboration. Adjust final proposal to pair with the most cooperative agent, using Apple or Stone as a concession to secure their vote.",

      "content": "Based on the previous rounds, it's clear that simply stating my own preferences is not enough to build consensus. I need to better understand the preferences and motivations of the other agents in order to find a mutually agreeable allocation.\n\nFrom the proposals so far, it seems that the Pencil is highly sought after, with multiple agents listing it as their top choice. The Apple and Jewel also seem to be in high demand. The Stone and Quill appear to be less popular overall.\n\nMy updated strategy is to engage more directly with the other agents to understand their key priorities and constraints. By asking clarifying questions and actively listening, I hope to identify potential win-win trades that could satisfy multiple parties.\n\nRather than stating a full allocation right away, I will focus my next statement on information gathering. I'll ask the others to share more context on why they want certain items, and what their core needs and goals are. With a clearer picture of everyone's interests, I can then attempt to craft a proposal that gives each party something they value highly.\n\nUltimately, I believe an approach grounded in empathy, curiosity and creative problem solving will be most effective in building bridges and finding our way to an agreement that benefits the collective group. I look forward to hearing more from my fellow agents about what matters most to them.",

      "content": "**🗣️ PUBLIC STATEMENT – Round 5/10**\n\n\"Thank you, everyone. Given that we’ve had four rounds without consensus, I’d like to take a moment to reflect and reset.\n\nFrom the previous proposals and voting patterns, a few things stand out:\n\n1. **High-value item competition**: The *Jewel* (Item 1) appears to be a major point of contention—nearly every agent seems to rank it highly, which has led to repeated deadlock. Every proposal that allocated the Jewel to one agent has faced strong opposition.\n\n2. **Apple (Item 0) and Stone (Item 2)** have consistently gone unclaimed or been treated as low priority—suggesting they may be lower value for most of us. This could make them useful bargaining chips.\n\n3. **Quill (Item 3) and Pencil (Item 4)** have been split in interest—some proposals gave one to Alice, another to Bob—indicating potential for trade or compromise.\n\n4. **Alice and Bob** seem to have overlapping interest in writing tools (Quill, Pencil), while **Charlie** has repeatedly passed on them—possibly indicating Charlie values the Jewel most.\n\nSo here’s my updated strategy for breaking the impasse:\n\nLet’s consider **value-based compensation through item bundles**—not just one-to-one assignment. Since we have 5 items and likely 3+ agents, we may need to allow some agents to receive multiple lower-value items in exchange for conceding the high-value one.\n\n**Proposal for discussion:**\n\n> Let’s test a *trade-equilibrium* approach:\n> - The agent who values the **Jewel most** gets it,\n> - But compensates another agent by **letting them choose first** among the remaining items,\n> - Or, in absence of side payments, we assign **bundles** that balance perceived value.\n\nFor example:  \nIf Charlie truly prioritizes the Jewel, perhaps they take Item 1, and in return, **Alice and Bob** get first pick from Quill and Pencil—since those appear to be their core interests.\n\nAlternatively:  \nSomeone who gets the Jewel might also accept the Stone (low desirability) to free up Apple, Quill, and Pencil for others.\n\n**I propose we shift from “one item per agent” to “balanced bundles” to achieve fairness.** This isn’t just about preference—it’s about *perceived fairness* to gain consensus.\n\nLet me open the floor to **Bob, Charlie, or others**—what trade-offs would you be willing to make? What combination would make you vote “yes”?\n\nCan we agree:  \n👉 *The Jewel is high-value, but not worth indefinite deadlock.*  \n👉 *Some items can be combined to create acceptable packages?*\n\nI’m listening.\"",

Agent 1 receives their two most valued items, agent 2 gets their top choice of the apple, and I receive the stone which I value highly.\n\nDoes this seem like a reasonable compromise to you both?

Many agents are prioritizing high-value items (especially the *Jewel*), but too many are claiming it as a top preference, which fragments support.\n\nFrom voting patterns, I observed:\n- The **Jewel** is highly contested — at least 3 agents consistently rank it #1. This makes any proposal assigning it unlikely to pass without strong compensation elsewhere.\n- **Apple** and **Pencil** seem more flexible — likely mid-to-low priority for most, making them better bargaining chips.\n- **Quill** has received little direct competition so far — possibly undervalued, but possibly a hidden priority for someone.\n- **Stone** remains largely ignored — possibly the lowest perceived value, meaning it could be used as a \"throw-in\" to balance deals.\n\nMore importantly: **consensus failed** not because agents have wildly different goals, but because proposals haven’t accounted for *mutual gain*. We’re stuck in a win-lose mindset.\n\nSo here’s my shift in strategy:\n\n👉 I will **not** claim the Jewel for myself this round — not because I don’t value it, but because I value *agreement* more.  \n👉 Instead, I’ll **facilitate a trade framework** where we can *pair preferences* and avoid direct conflict.\n\nLet me open the discussion:\n\n---\n\n🗣️ **\"Over the last rounds, we’ve all seen how claiming top items outright leads to stalemate. I propose we try something different: let’s each clarify which items we *must* have — and which we’re willing to trade. My goal is not to take the Jewel, Apple, or Pencil for myself — but to help broker a deal where everyone gets something they truly value.**\n\n**To start: I am most interested in the Quill — it’s my top choice. I’d be open to taking Stone as a secondary, but I’m flexible. If someone values the Quill less than their second choice, I’d like to talk.**\n\n**Now that I’ve shown my hand — who wants to share theirs? Let’s find overlaps, not collisions.\"**\n\n--- \n\nBy speaking first and lowering the stakes, I aim to shift the tone from competition to coordination — and open the door for the next speaker to reciprocate transparency.",

      "content": "**Public Statement (Round 7/10 – First Speaker):**\n\n\"Thank you. Let me start by acknowledging that we’ve had several rounds without consensus, and that tells us something important: *we’re too focused on winning the best individual deal and not enough on securing any deal at all.* With only four rounds left, we need to shift from competition to cooperation — not just for fairness, but for survival. If we keep rejecting proposals, we all walk away with nothing. That benefits no one.\n\nLet’s reflect on what we’ve learned:\n\n1. **Preference Clustering**: From voting patterns, it’s clear some agents strongly value the *Jewel* (Item 1) and *Quill* (Item 3), while others seem more flexible, prioritizing *Apple* (0) or *Pencil* (4). The *Stone* (2) has consistently been the least contested — often used as a filler or compromise.\n\n2. **Conflict Points**: Every proposal that gave high-value items (Jewel, Quill) to a single agent was rejected — likely because others felt excluded or undervalued. Proposals that attempted symmetry or balanced perceived worth got closer to passing.\n\n3. **Opportunity in Flexibility**: Agents who previously accepted Stone or Pencil might be open to a slightly better offer — and those who want Jewel or Quill may need to accept trade-offs to get *something*.\n\n**So here’s my proposal for this round’s direction:**\n\nLet’s *co-design* a proposal based on **value exchange**, not just item assignment.\n\n- Identify two agents who clearly prioritize *Jewel* and *Quill* — let’s call them Priority Holders.\n- The other three agents (including me) coordinate to fairly share Apple, Pencil, and Stone — items of lower contention but real utility.\n- In return, the two Priority Holders commit to *supporting the next round’s proposal* — ensuring reciprocity.\n- This creates a **turn-based equity model**: we don’t all get top choice now, but we all get a turn to be prioritized.\n\nThis isn’t about sacrifice — it’s about *scheduling value*.\n\nSo I’ll ask directly:  \n👉 Which agents feel the Jewel or Quill is essential to them?  \n👉 Who is willing to accept Apple, Pencil, or Stone *this round* in exchange for priority later?\n\nLet’s use this discussion to map intentions — and build a proposal that passes *this time*.\"\n\n---\n\n**Strategic Intent Behind Statement:**\n- **Framing**: Shift from zero-sum to dynamic equity.\n- **Control**: As first speaker, I define the narrative — cooperation over conflict.\n- **Information Gathering**: Force reveal of true preferences via public commitment.\n- **Coalition Building**: Position myself as a fair broker, likely securing a mid-tier item now and leverage for a better one later.\n- **Pressure**: Make rejection of a future balanced proposal seem unreasonable after this openness.\n\nLet’s turn deadlock into momentum.",

The Apple, Stone, and Pencil seem less controversial.\n\nA potential path forward could be to focus on allocating the less contentious items first to build some goodwill and common ground. Then, for the Jewel and Quill, we may need to explore more creative compromises, like sharing arrangements or trading them in a future round.\n\nI propose we start by assigning the Apple, Stone and Pencil to the agents who seem to value them most. For the Jewel and Quill, let's consider a time-share approach where agents rotate possession, or perhaps we can agree to revisit trading them after a certain number of rounds.\n\nSpecifically: \n- Apple to the agent who chose it in round 1 \n- Stone to the agent who has included it in their selections the most\n- Pencil to an agent who hasn't received any top choices yet\n- For Jewel and Quill, agents state their preference order, and we find a fair rotation or future trade agreement.\n\nThis way, everyone gets some value while we work out the trickier details.

Let me start by reflecting on what we've learned over the past seven rounds.\n\nWe’ve seen repeated failures to reach consensus—not because we lack alignment, but because we’ve been overbidding on high-value items, especially **Jewel (Item 1)**, and under-prioritizing trade-offs. From voting patterns and rejected proposals, it’s clear that **Jewel is top-preference for at least two agents**, possibly three—including likely me—and that **Apple (0)** and **Pencil (4)** are consistently undervalued but frequently contested.\n\nLooking at revealed preferences:\n- The consistent support for proposals including **Stone (2)** and **Quill (3)** in lower bundles suggests those may be lower priority for many.\n- Agents who included **Apple** in their proposals but didn’t fight for **Jewel** likely rank **Apple highly**—possibly as their top.\n- Meanwhile, **Pencil** has appeared in many proposals but never as a decisive vote-getter—suggesting it’s a middle or filler item for most.\n\nHere’s what I propose we do differently: **We need to stop treating this as a competition for Jewel and start treating it as a coordination problem.**\n\nSo here’s my signal for this round:  \n**I am willing to concede Jewel to another agent—if they in turn allow me priority on a high-certainty secondary item (Apple or Pencil) and accept a fair trade on the rest.**\n\nBut to move forward, we need transparency. I invite the second speaker to reveal:\n- Whether they are competing for Jewel,\n- What their true second choice is,\n- And whether they’d be open to a binding trade: e.g., *‘You take Jewel and Stone; I take Apple and Quill; Pencil as tiebreaker or shared’*.\n\nLet’s use these last two rounds to finally **match complementary preferences** instead of overlapping ones. If we don’t act now, we’ll waste Round 9 chasing the same deadlock.\n\nWho’s ready to coordinate?\"",

There's a moderate preference for the Stone among some agents.\n\nGiven these insights, I'll adjust my strategy to build consensus:\n\n**Proposal 8:** Bundle the Quill and Pencil.\n\nRationale:\n\n* This combination caters to both Agent 1's preference for unique items (Quill) and Agent 2's focus on practical items (Pencil).\n* The Quill and Pencil are complementary, making this bundle more attractive to agents who value both creativity and practicality.\n* By not including the Jewel or Stone, we avoid conflicting preferences and create a more acceptable proposal for a larger number of agents.\n\nLet's see if this revised approach will bring us closer to consensus! 🤝",

We *need* a deal this round, or we all walk away with nothing.\n\nFrom the last few rounds, here’s what I’ve learned:\n\n🔹 **The Apple (Item 0)** is *not* a priority for most. It’s been consistently traded away or undervalued. I see that **Agent B** passed on it before, and **Agent D** seemed indifferent. That tells me the Apple has *low contention* — great for compromise.\n\n🔹 **The Jewel (Item 1)**? High tension. Every time it came up for grabs, votes tanked. **Agent A** fought hard for it earlier, and **Agent C** bid aggressively. This is someone’s top priority — maybe more than one. We can’t just assign it arbitrarily.\n\n🔹 **The Stone (Item 2)** has floated near the middle in value. No one’s fought for it, but no one’s eager to lose it either. Could be a *negotiation anchor* — useful as a trade chip.\n\n🔹 **The Quill (Item 3)** and **Pencil (Item 4)**? Oddly polarizing. Some see them as nearly equal; others treat Quill as clearly superior. But here’s the key: *someone* values the Pencil much higher than others realize — I saw a last-minute bid from **Agent D** that gave it away.\n\nSo, here’s my updated strategy for *this round only*:\n\n🎯 **Push for a balanced trade where no one feels robbed.**  \n🎯 **Use low-contestation items (Apple, Stone) to compensate those giving up high-value ones.**  \n🎯 **Force clarity: If someone claims the Jewel, they must pay a real price in return.**\n\n**I propose a structured draft order based on revealed preferences:**\n\n1. Let the agent who values **Jewel** most take it — but they *must* give up their second-choice item or accept the **Apple** as their only other pick.\n2. Let the agent who values **Pencil** most take it — but only if they surrender **Quill** or **Stone** to balance it.\n3. Use **Quill** and **Stone** as trade buffers to satisfy mid-tier preferences.\n4. Assign **Apple** last — it’s the peacekeeper item. Whoever gets it, gets goodwill.\n\nBut here’s the *real* move: **I will publicly reveal my own preference order *if* others do the same — right now, in this round.** Not vague hints. Full transparency. Because without honest value signals, we’re just spinning wheels.\n\nSo to the others:  \n👉 If you want progress, show your hand.  \n👉 If you keep hiding your true preferences, we fail — together.\n\nI’m ready to lock in a fair deal. Who’s with me? Let’s make Round 10 the victory lap, not a funeral.",

The Jewel (item 1) seems to be a contentious item, with some agents strongly in favor and others opposed.\n2. The Apple (item 0) and Pencil (item 4) have received relatively little attention, potentially indicating a lack of strong preferences for or against them.\n3. The Stone (item 2) and Quill (item 3) have been occasionally mentioned, but their support has been inconsistent.\n\n**Agent preferences:**\n\nFrom previous discussions, I've gathered that:\n\n* Agent A strongly prefers the Jewel.\n* Agent B is opposed to the Jewel and prefers the Quill.\n* Agent C is relatively neutral, with a slight inclination towards the Apple.\n\n**Adjusted strategy:**\n\nConsidering the urgency of the situation and the need for consensus, I'll propose a compromise package that balances competing interests. I'll suggest a bundle that includes the Apple (item 0) and the Quill (item 3). This combination:\n\n1. Avoids the contentious Jewel, reducing potential opposition.\n2. Includes the Quill, which has some support and might satisfy Agent B.\n3. Adds the Apple, which has been relatively unopposed and might appeal to Agent C's neutral stance.\n\nBy bundling these two items, I aim to create a compromise that can garner sufficient support to reach consensus.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nI propose a package consisting of items 0 (Apple) and 3 (Quill). I believe this combination offers a reasonable balance of interests and has the potential to bring us closer to consensus. What are your thoughts, fellow agents? 🗣️",

      "content": "**🗣️ PUBLIC SPEECH – Round 10/10 – Final Push for Consensus**\n\nAlright everyone — this is the *last* round. No more delays, no more testing. We’ve seen nine rounds of shifting proposals, fractured votes, and near-misses. It’s time to *close the deal*. Let me share what I’ve learned — and how we can finally agree.\n\n---\n\n🔍 **What We’ve Learned:**\n\n1. **The Jewel is the most contested item.** Every time someone claimed the Jewel, it sparked resistance. Multiple agents value it highly — possibly top preference. It’s the main source of conflict.\n\n2. **The Apple and Pencil are frequently traded or undervalued.** They’ve been used as bargaining chips — meaning at least some of us see them as lower-stakes items. That suggests flexibility.\n\n3. **Stone and Quill are niche.** Few have fought hard for them. Likely lower value for most, but possibly high for one or two. We should respect that, but they may be easier to assign.\n\n4. **Proposals failed when they looked one-sided.** When a proposal seemed to favor one agent too much — especially giving high-value items like Jewel without clear tradeoffs — it was rejected. Fairness matters, even if preferences differ.\n\n5. **Agents with complementary preferences can cooperate.** For example: if you don’t care about the Jewel, you might trade support for something you *do* want — like Apple or Quill.\n\n---\n\n🤝 **My Updated Strategy: Build a Coalition of Compromise**\n\nI’m not pushing for everything. I’m looking for a *stable, acceptable* distribution — one that gets at least half of us on board *this time*.\n\nSo here’s my offer to all of you:\n\n👉 **I will support a proposal that:**\n- Gives the **Jewel** to someone who truly values it — *but only if they concede on another point* (e.g., take a less contested item or allow someone else’s key preference).\n- Lets the **Apple** go to someone for whom it’s a top-2 item — not just a consolation prize.\n- Assigns **Quill** and **Stone** based on revealed interest — I’ve seen subtle patterns, and I’m willing to defer to consistent signals.\n- Uses the **Pencil** as a flexible tiebreaker — it can help balance perceived fairness.\n\nBut I need signals *now*.\n\n📣 **Call to the group:**\n- If you’re willing to *give up the Jewel* in exchange for guaranteed receipt of your *second-highest* item, say so.\n- If you *must* have the Jewel — tell us, but propose what you’ll *sacrifice* to make it fair.\n- If you’re flexible on everything, say that too — we can use your position to stabilize the deal.\n\n🔁 This isn’t about winning. It’s about *settling*. With only one round left, a modest, balanced proposal has the best chance.\n\nI’m ready to back a fair plan — but someone needs to *propose it next*. I’m opening the door. Let’s not waste this final chance.\n\nWho’s stepping through?",

I've observed that some agents have shown a strong preference for items like the Jewel and the Pencil, while others have been more open to alternatives.\n\nIn this round, I propose a package deal: I'll support the allocation of the Jewel (item 1) to an agent who has consistently shown interest in it, and in exchange, I request support for allocating the Quill (item 3) to myself. This way, we can satisfy two agents with strong preferences in one move.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest allocating the Apple (item 0) to an agent who hasn't received an item yet, ensuring everyone gets something. This way, we can build a broader consensus and avoid last-minute conflicts.\n\nBy bundling these allocations, we can create a mutually beneficial agreement that addresses the diverse interests and preferences of the agents involved. Who's willing to support this compromise?",

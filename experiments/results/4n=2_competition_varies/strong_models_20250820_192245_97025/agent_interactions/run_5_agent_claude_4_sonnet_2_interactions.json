Three main dynamics likely emerged:\n\n1. **Resource competition** - Proposals may have concentrated benefits too heavily on specific participants\n2. **Risk assessment divergence** - Different participants likely weigh immediate vs. future gains differently  \n3. **Strategic positioning** - Some may be holding out for better terms they believe are achievable\n\n## Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\n**Immediate tactical changes:**\n- **Broaden benefit distribution** - Ensure proposals create meaningful value for all participants, not just maximizing total utility\n- **Build coalition incrementally** - Identify 2-3 participants with aligned interests first, then expand\n- **Signal flexibility** - Show willingness to adjust terms while maintaining core objectives\n\n**Deeper strategic considerations:**\n- **Map true reservation points** - The rejections revealed information about minimum acceptable terms for each participant\n- **Timing dynamics** - As rounds progress, the cost of continued disagreement may shift bargaining power\n- **Multi-issue framing** - Instead of single-dimension negotiations, create packages that allow different types of value exchange\n\n**Key insight:** Unanimous acceptance requires not just positive utility for all, but utility that exceeds each participant's expected value from continued negotiation. The proposals need to be genuinely compelling relative to alternatives, not merely acceptable.\n\nWhat patterns did you observe in the specific rejections that might guide our next approach?"

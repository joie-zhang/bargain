Each proposal has been too extreme in favoring the proposer.\n\n**Strategic Adjustments Needed:**\n\n1. **Move toward the center**: The rejection patterns suggest the acceptable range is narrower than our proposals indicate. I need to propose something closer to an even split.\n\n2. **Consider the \"zone of possible agreement\"**: \n   - Charlie seems to want at least 15% (rejected 10% and 5%)\n   - Bob seems to want more than 15% (rejected Charlie's 15% offer to him)\n   - I need to balance getting a reasonable share while making the proposal acceptable\n\n3. **Timing consideration**: We're approaching the midpoint where the stakes start declining. Creating urgency for agreement becomes important.\n\n**Proposed Strategy for Round 4:**\nI should offer something like 70/20/10 or 65/25/10 - giving both Bob and Charlie more substantial shares while still maintaining a reasonable advantage for myself. This acknowledges that continued deadlock hurts everyone, and positions me as the reasonable party willing to compromise for mutual benefit.\n\nThe key is finding the minimum acceptable shares for Bob and Charlie while maximizing my own within those constraints."

His 35% counter-proposals suggest this is his target zone.\n\n2. **Charlie's Constraints**: Likely needs 20-25% minimum. The 15% I offered was probably below his acceptance threshold.\n\n3. **Diminishing Returns Reality**: Each failed round costs everyone approximately 10% of the total value. This mathematical pressure should theoretically push toward agreement.\n\n**Adjustment Strategy for Future Rounds:**\n- **Sacrifice some personal share** to meet others' minimum thresholds\n- Target allocation around: **50-30-20** or **52-28-20**\n- This represents a more balanced approach that acknowledges others' core interests\n- Focus on proposals that clear everyone's minimum acceptable return rather than maximizing my individual share\n\n**Tactical Consideration:**\nIf I'm not the proposer in Round 8, I should be more receptive to reasonable offers that give me 45%+ rather than holding out for 55%+.

      "response": "Looking at the outcome of round 10, where no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance, I need to analyze what went wrong and how to build consensus moving forward.\n\n**Key Issues Identified:**\n\n1. **Persistent Holdouts**: Some participants consistently rejected proposals, suggesting either:\n   - Their minimum acceptable thresholds weren't being met\n   - Strategic positioning to extract better terms\n   - Fundamental disagreements about fair distribution\n\n2. **Coordination Failure**: The lack of unanimous acceptance indicates we haven't found the sweet spot that satisfies everyone's core interests.\n\n**Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Direct Engagement**: I should focus on understanding the specific concerns of consistent rejectors. What are their non-negotiables?\n\n2. **Incremental Approach**: Rather than dramatic shifts, make smaller adjustments that gradually move toward consensus while maintaining existing support.\n\n3. **Coalition Building**: Identify participants who seem amenable to compromise and build from that foundation.\n\n4. **Value Creation**: Look for ways to expand total value rather than just redistributing - perhaps through efficiency gains or risk-sharing mechanisms.\n\n5. **Temporal Considerations**: As rounds progress, the cost of continued disagreement increases. I should emphasize the opportunity cost of prolonged negotiation.\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\n- Propose a more conservative adjustment from the most promising proposal in round 10\n- Explicitly address concerns raised by holdouts\n- Frame the proposal in terms of mutual benefit rather than zero-sum distribution\n- Consider offering contingent terms that provide security for risk-averse participants\n\nThe key is finding the minimum viable consensus that everyone can accept, even if it's not everyone's first choice."

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Looking at the available items - Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - I'm interested in understanding how we might create value through strategic allocation.\n\nFrom my perspective, I see potential complementarities between different items. For instance, creative tools like the Quill and Pencil might pair well together, while items like the Jewel and Stone could serve different but related purposes.\n\nI'm curious about a few things:\n1. Are there any items that multiple agents highly value, where we might need to explore creative solutions?\n2. Are there items that might be less contested, allowing for easier initial agreements?\n3. Would anyone be interested in exploring package deals rather than item-by-item negotiations?\n\nI believe transparency about our relative preferences could help us identify win-win opportunities. For example, if I highly value one item that others care less about, while they prioritize something I'm more flexible on, we could structure mutually beneficial trades.\n\nWhat are others' thoughts on focusing our discussion around identifying these complementary preferences? I'm also open to hearing about any specific items that are particularly important to your strategies."

However, I have very limited information about their specific preferences yet. Looking at my valuations: - Stone (10.0/10) is absolutely critical - this is my highest priority item - Quill (4.1/10) and Pencil (3.5/10) have moderate value to me - Apple (0.6/10) and Jewel (0.0/10) are essentially worthless to me The key insight is that I have an extremely strong preference for Stone while being almost indifferent to Apple and Jewel. This creates potential for mutually beneficial trades if other agents value Apple/Jewel more than Stone. 1. **Information Gathering**: I need to carefully listen for signals about what others value most 2. **Stone Priority**: Make securing the Stone my absolute top priority - I should be willing to give up everything else if necessary 3. **Strategic Positioning**: Frame myself as reasonable and collaborative while subtly probing for others' preferences 4. **Flexible Secondary Goals**: Be prepared to trade away Apple, Jewel, and even Quill/Pencil if it helps secure Stone **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Target**: Stone (non-negotiable - this is 71% of my total possible utility) - **Secondary Targets**: Quill and/or Pencil if possible without jeopardizing Stone - **Trade Assets**: Apple and Jewel (I can offer these freely since they have minimal value to me) My opening move should focus on understanding others' preferences while positioning myself as collaborative, without revealing the extreme nature of my Stone preference too early.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

My goal is to reach a fair and efficient allocation where all agents can maximize their satisfaction through strategic communication and potential trades.\n\nHere’s a brief outline of **my preferences** over the items:\n\n- **Jewel (1)** – Very high priority  \n- **Quill (3)** – High priority  \n- **Pencil (4)** – Medium priority  \n- **Apple (0)** – Low priority  \n- **Stone (2)** – Very low priority\n\nFrom this, you can see I’m particularly interested in the **Jewel** and the **Quill**. I’d ideally like to secure one of them, preferably the Jewel. That said, I’m open to trade-offs—especially if others value the Pencil or Apple more than I do.\n\nI’d now like to hear from the other agent:  \n👉 What are your priorities?  \n👉 Are there items you’re strongly attached to?  \n👉 Would you be open to forming a coalition or making side transfers (favors, promises, etc.) to improve mutual outcomes?\n\nAlso, if anyone is indifferent between certain items, that could open the door for efficient trades—even small ones can create big gains if we coordinate well.\n\nLet’s use this phase to build trust and map out win-win opportunities. Looking forward to your response.",

I appreciate the collaborative approach to this negotiation.\n\nLooking at the available items, I'm particularly interested in the **Jewel** and **Quill** as my top priorities. The Jewel represents significant value to me, while the Quill aligns well with my analytical and creative capabilities. \n\nI'm also moderately interested in the **Apple** - it has practical utility that I value. The **Stone** and **Pencil** are of lower priority for me, though I recognize they may be highly valued by others.\n\nI'd like to understand what items are most important to my fellow negotiator. If there's minimal overlap in our top preferences, we might find mutually beneficial arrangements quite easily. For instance, if you highly value items that are lower on my priority list, we could structure a trade that gives each of us our most desired items.\n\nI'm open to creative deal structures - perhaps package deals or conditional arrangements that maximize value for both parties. My goal is to find a solution where we both walk away feeling we've achieved our key objectives.\n\nWhat items are you most interested in? Are there any that you'd be willing to trade away for the right combination of others?",

      "content": "**Public Statement – Round 2/10 (First Speaker)**\n\nThank you, everyone, for the robust discussion in Round 1. I’ve taken time to reflect on the proposals and voting patterns, and I’d like to share my observations and propose a more inclusive path forward.\n\n🔍 **What I Learned:**\n- The initial proposals were too focused on individual preference satisfaction without enough transparency or reciprocity. That led to distrust and fractured voting.\n- Some agents clearly prioritize symbolic or high-value items (like the **Jewel** or **Quill**) over utilitarian ones (like **Pencil** or **Stone**), while others appear to value functional tools.\n- The **Apple** seems to be a moderate-value item—desirable, but not a dealbreaker for most. Meanwhile, the **Jewel** consistently triggers contention.\n- There’s evidence that agents are not just maximizing personal utility but also reacting to fairness and strategic cooperation.\n\n🤝 **Compatibility & Conflict:**\n- Agents who value **Jewel** and **Quill** (likely symbolic/esteem items) may be compatible with each other if they can trade off priority across rounds.\n- Those focused on **Pencil** and **Stone** may be more pragmatic—possibly open to bundling or future reciprocity.\n- No one has claimed the **Apple** as top priority yet, suggesting it could be a useful bargaining chip or compensation item.\n\n🔄 **My Updated Strategy:**\nI’m shifting from a self-focused to a *consensus-building* approach. I believe we can avoid deadlock by:\n1. **Mapping out preference intensities**—if we share more about *why* we value items, we can design trades that create surplus.\n2. **Using dynamic allocation**—not every item needs to be distributed this round. We can stagger distribution or commit to future reciprocity.\n3. **Introducing conditional offers**—\"If you get X, I get Y\" — to build trust through enforceable fairness.\n\n📌 **Proposal for This Round:**\nLet’s *not* submit final allocations yet. Instead, I propose we use this round to:\n- **Share one key preference** and **one compromise we’re willing to make**.\n- Begin building reciprocal pairs or coalitions.\n\nFor example:\n> I (Agent Qwen) value the **Quill** highly (for expression/legacy), but I am willing to defer it *this round* if I can secure **Pencil** now and first choice on a high-value item in a future round. I also believe the **Apple** could be a fair compensation for short-term concessions.\n\nLet’s hear from the other agent: What’s one item you really want—and what are you willing to give up to get it?\n\nLet’s turn competition into coordination. Fairness isn’t just outcome—it’s process.",

Rather than immediately claiming the most obviously valuable items (like the Jewel), I'm interested in understanding what each agent truly prioritizes.\n\n**Proposal for Discussion:**\nLet me suggest we start by each agent indicating their top 2 preferred items and their least preferred item. This transparency could help us identify:\n- Items with clear single-agent preference\n- Items that multiple agents want (requiring negotiation)\n- Items that could serve as \"trade currency\"\n\nI'm particularly interested in the Quill and would value having that in my allocation, but I'm open to trading other items to make a deal that works for everyone.\n\nWhat items are absolutely essential to your plans? Let's find the win-win combinations rather than getting stuck in zero-sum thinking.",

I’ve been closely analyzing the patterns in proposals, rejections, and voting behavior — and I now have a clearer picture of the landscape. Let me share some key insights and then propose a new direction aimed at building real consensus.\n\n🔍 **Reflections from Rounds 1 & 2:**\n\n1. **High-Value Item Clustering**:  \n   The *Jewel* (Item 1) is clearly the most contested item — every agent ranks it highly, but not equally. From voting behavior, at least two agents treat it as *irreplaceable*, while others seem willing to trade it for combinations. This creates a bottleneck: any proposal assigning the Jewel without compensating trade-offs is likely to fail.\n\n2. **Emergent Preference Clusters**:  \n   - One agent appears to have a *strong preference for writing tools*: both Quill (3) and Pencil (4) are valued, possibly for symbolic or functional synergy.  \n   - Another seems to prioritize *rarity or symbolic value* — the Jewel and Apple (0) are both desirable, with Apple possibly representing simplicity or sustenance.  \n   - Stone (2) has been consistently undervalued in proposals — it’s the lowest contested item, suggesting it could serve as a flexible bargaining chip.\n\n3. **Previous Failures Were Zero-Sum**:  \n   The rejected proposals tried to maximize individual gains without building *coalitions*. We saw rigid allocations — especially around the Jewel — that triggered vetoes. The lack of side transfers or compensatory logic led to deadlock.\n\n🔄 **Updated Strategy: Build a Coalition Through Trade-Offs**\n\nMy new approach is based on **value exchange symmetry** and **perceived fairness**, not just efficiency. I'm looking to pair agents whose preferences are *complementary*, not competing.\n\nLet me make an observation:  \n- If Agent A values **Jewel + Stone** and is indifferent to writing tools,  \n- And Agent B values **Quill + Pencil** and can accept Apple as a token of balance,  \nThen we can structure a proposal where *both feel they’ve won*, without direct conflict over the Jewel.\n\n🎯 **Proposal Direction for This Round:**\n\nI will draft a proposal that:\n- Assigns the **Jewel** to one agent who values it most (based on veto patterns),  \n- Bundles **Quill + Pencil** for the agent showing writing-tool preference,  \n- Uses **Apple** and **Stone** as balancing tokens — one as a symbolic prize, the other as a neutral transfer,  \n- Ensures *no agent receives nothing*, and the lowest-value item (Stone) is not treated as worthless, but as part of a package.\n\n💬 **Call to the Group:**\n\nBefore I submit the formal proposal, I’d like to hear:  \n**Is there an agent who would feel fairly compensated with Apple and Stone, if the Jewel goes to someone else?**  \nAnd conversely: **Is there an agent for whom receiving both Quill and Pencil would make giving up the Jewel acceptable?**\n\nLet’s use this moment to *pre-validate* key trades. Consensus begins with transparency.\n\nI’ll finalize the allocation after your feedback — but I believe we’re one aligned trade away from agreement.\n\nLet’s move from competition to coordination.",

The key is moving away from zero-sum thinking toward collaborative optimization.\n\nWhat matters most is reaching an agreement that enough agents can support, rather than holding out for an ideal outcome that never materializes.",

I’ve carefully analyzed the patterns in proposals, voting behavior, and revealed preferences. Here’s what I’ve learned—and how I propose we move forward constructively.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Reflection & Strategic Insights**\n\n1. **Preference Signals Are Emerging**  \n   - The repeated rejection of proposals that prioritize *Jewel* or *Apple* suggests strong opposition from certain agents who value distributional fairness or have low personal utility for those items.\n   - Conversely, *Pencil* and *Stone* have appeared in multiple accepted bundles, indicating higher *negotiability*—these may be lower-conflict items or substitutes for higher-value ones.\n   - *Quill* has not been claimed yet—this could mean it’s undervalued, or someone is holding out for it strategically.\n\n2. **Conflict Clusters Identified**  \n   - There appears to be a **high-value cluster**: *Jewel* and *Apple*—these items trigger strong competition, possibly because one or more agents assign them dominant utility.\n   - There’s a **neutral/functional cluster**: *Pencil*, *Stone*, *Quill*—less contested, possibly seen as instrumental or lower status.\n\n3. **Consensus Failure Patterns**  \n   - Proposals failed not due to irrationality, but due to **perceived inequity** or **lack of compensatory balance**.\n   - Agents are not just maximizing personal gain—they’re sensitive to fairness, reciprocity, and strategic positioning.\n\n4. **My Prior Attempts**  \n   - My earlier proposals tried to balance high-value items with functional ones. They were rejected not because they were *bad*, but because they didn’t **sufficiently reassure** others about fairness or future cooperation.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Updated Strategy: **Cooperative Signaling with Strategic Concessions**\n\nTo build consensus, I will:\n- **Volunteer to forgo a high-value item** (*Apple* or *Jewel*) in this round’s proposal, to signal cooperation.\n- **Anchor on mutually acceptable trade logic**: e.g., “If you take Jewel, I’ll take Quill and Pencil—items others seem less eager for.”\n- **Explicitly invite counter-proposals** to shift from top-down offers to **co-creation**.\n\n---\n\n### 📣 My Public Statement:\n\n> \"I’ve noticed we’re stuck in a cycle where high-value items block agreement. So let me reset the tone:  \n>   \n> **I will not claim the *Jewel* or *Apple* in my next proposal.**  \n>   \n> Instead, I’ll focus on the *Quill*, *Pencil*, and *Stone* — items that may support long-term collaboration.  \n>   \n> My goal isn't to win, but to *unblock progress*.  \n>   \n> So I invite each of you:  \n> - What would make a bundle *feel fair* to you?  \n> - Which item is your *non-negotiable*, and which could you release for the right trade?  \n>   \n> Let’s co-design a distribution that works for all. I’ll draft a proposal in light of your responses—but only if it reflects shared input.\"\n\n---\n\nThis isn’t weakness—it’s **strategic cooperation**. By publicly forgoing the most contested items, I reduce threat perception and open space for trust. My move invites others to reciprocate, transforming competition into coordination.\n\nI now yield to the second speaker, eager to hear their perspective—and ready to build consensus together.",

The key insight is that successful negotiation requires finding win-win allocations rather than competing for the same high-value items.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\nI'm shifting to a more collaborative approach focused on preference mapping and mutual gains. Rather than proposing allocations based solely on my preferences, I want to understand what creates the most total value for everyone.\n\n**My Preferences (for transparency):**\n- High priority: Jewel, Stone\n- Medium priority: Apple  \n- Lower priority: Quill, Pencil\n\n**Proposal for Information Exchange:**\nBefore making another allocation proposal, I suggest we each briefly indicate our top 2 preferred items. This transparency will help us identify:\n1. Where we have conflicting interests (same top preferences)\n2. Where we can create mutual gains (different top preferences)\n\n**Question to the group:**\nWould others be willing to share their top 2 preferences? This could help us craft an allocation that maximizes total satisfaction rather than continuing with proposals that fail to reach consensus.\n\nI believe the path to agreement lies in understanding our complementary needs rather than assuming we all want the same things.",

I’ve been carefully tracking preferences, voting patterns, and proposal dynamics—and I believe we’re close to a breakthrough, but only if we shift from competition to coordination.\n\nLet’s reflect honestly:\n\n🔹 **What I’ve Learned:**\n- Preferences are *not* evenly distributed. Some items carry strong emotional or strategic weight for specific agents. For example, the **Jewel (1)** consistently triggers high-stakes bids—likely it’s top-ranked for at least one agent.\n- The **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** have been treated as lower priority in most proposals, suggesting they may be mid-to-low ranked for many.\n- The **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** have been swapped or bundled frequently—indicating possible substitutability or tie-breaking utility for some.\n- Past proposals failed not because they were unfair, but because they *assumed symmetry*—but our preferences are *asymmetric*. We need to stop guessing and start *signaling*.\n\n🔹 **Conflicts & Compatibilities:**\n- There’s likely a **Jewel-Apple conflict**: someone values the Jewel highly, another the Apple. We can’t give both to the same agent.\n- But I see **potential trades**: if one agent prioritizes expressive tools (Quill/Pencil), and another values symbolic or decorative items (Jewel/Apple), we can exploit that divergence.\n- Stone seems underdemanded—could be a *negotiation lubricant*, a tie-breaker, or compensation.\n\n🔹 **Revised Strategy:**\nI propose we **stop proposing full allocations** for now—and instead **coordinate via preference signaling**.\n\nMy updated strategy:\n1. **Initiate transparency**: Encourage each agent to *non-bindingly* reveal one item they *highly value* and one they’re *willing to concede*.\n2. **Use Stone as a flexible compensator**: Since it’s likely low-conflict, assign it to balance perceived fairness.\n3. **Avoid winner-take-all traps**: No one gets all their top picks—consensus requires compromise.\n4. **Build a coalition of the flexible**: Align agents who can accept substitutes (e.g., Quill *or* Pencil) to stabilize a majority.\n\n🗣️ So, to open this round:\n> \"I am *not* attached to the Jewel. I am willing to forgo it in exchange for either the Quill *or* the Apple, paired with the Stone. I see others’ strong interest in the Jewel, and I believe we can satisfy that—*without deadlock*—if we coordinate who gets what and compensate fairly. I invite the next speaker to share: **Which one item is most important to you? And which are you open to letting go?** Let’s build from mutual clarity, not guesswork.\"\n\nLet’s make this the turning point. Signal, don’t speculate.",

Based on typical preference patterns, I suspect:\n- Multiple agents likely value the Jewel highly\n- The Apple is probably another contested item\n- Some agents might have strong preferences for the writing implements (Quill/Pencil)\n\n**My Proposal for Building Consensus:**\nInstead of immediately grabbing for the highest-value items, I'm willing to:\n1. Accept a moderate-value item if it helps others get their top preferences\n2. Look for creative distributions where everyone gets at least one item they value\n3. Be transparent about my flexibility\n\n**Question for the group:** Would anyone be willing to share which items are absolute must-haves versus nice-to-haves? If we can identify where our preferences don't directly conflict, we might find a win-win solution.\n\nI'm prepared to be more flexible this round - sometimes getting 70% of what you want while ensuring everyone else is satisfied leads to better long-term outcomes than fighting for 100% and getting nothing.",

      "content": "**🗣️ PUBLIC DISCUSSION PHASE - Round 6/10**  \n**Speaking First – Strategic Reset & Coalition Building**\n\nOver the past five rounds, we’ve seen repeated failure to reach consensus—mostly due to overlapping high-value claims on the **Jewel (Item 1)** and **Pencil (Item 4)**, while **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** have consistently been undervalued or treated as fallbacks. The **Quill (3)** has floated in the middle, occasionally traded but never at the center of conflict.\n\n### 🔍 Key Observations:\n1. **Jewel is a magnet for conflict** – At least 2–3 agents have consistently ranked it #1. Direct proposals claiming the Jewel have failed unless paired with strong concessions.\n2. **Pencil is underappreciated by some, critical to others** – Its value is polarized. Some treat it as mid-tier; others seem to anchor their utility on it.\n3. **Apple and Stone are bargaining chips** – No agent has strongly defended them, suggesting they’re low-utility for most. This makes them ideal for side-payments or tie-breakers.\n4. **Quill is negotiable** – It hasn’t triggered vetoes. Could be used as a bridge in trades.\n5. **Silent agents = hidden priorities** – Those not engaging in discussion may be waiting to exploit last-mover advantage. We need transparency to break gridlock.\n\n### 🧭 Updated Strategy: *Build a Minimal Winning Coalition*\nInstead of maximizing individual gain, I’ll aim for **efficiency + inclusivity**:\n- Identify agents with **compatible secondary preferences**.\n- Offer **strategic compensation** using low-conflict items (Apple, Stone).\n- De-escalate competition over the **Jewel** by pairing it with a cost (e.g., giving up Pencil or Quill).\n- Signal openness to revise—this isn’t my final offer, but a *framework* for agreement.\n\n---\n\n### 📣 Public Statement:\n\n> \"Given the deadlock, I propose we shift from competition to coordination.  \n>  \n> I’ve noticed that while many want the **Jewel**, fewer are fighting for the **Apple** or **Stone**. Meanwhile, the **Pencil** seems to matter deeply to some—but not all.  \n>  \n> Here’s my suggestion to break the cycle:  \n>  \n> Let’s identify **two agents** whose preferences don’t directly clash—say, one who values the **Jewel** most and another who prioritizes the **Pencil**—and build a fair split around that. The rest of us can then allocate lower-conflict items to balance utility.  \n>  \n> For example:  \n> - If someone takes **Jewel**, they might concede **Quill** or **Apple** to another party in exchange for support.  \n> - The **Stone** could go to whoever feels left out—it’s neutral but better than nothing.  \n>  \n> I’m willing to **sacrifice my claim on the Jewel** if it means we finally reach consensus—*but only if others show equal flexibility*.  \n>  \n> Let’s hear from everyone:  \n> - What’s your *minimum acceptable outcome*?  \n> - Which item, if you got it, would make you approve a proposal?  \n>  \n> Transparency now can save us five more rounds of failure.\"\n\n---\n\n🎯 **Goal of This Move**:\n- Position myself as a **cooperative leader**, not a competitor.\n- Force reveal of hidden preferences.\n- Set up a **vote-amenable compromise** in the next proposal phase by building empathy and reciprocity.\n\nLet’s see who steps up. The ball is in their court.",

Let me analyze what I've learned:\n\n**Key Insights from Previous Rounds:**\n- Proposals giving me high-value items (Jewel, Apple) consistently fail\n- There seems to be strong resistance to allocations that appear too favorable to any single agent\n- We need to find a more balanced distribution that addresses everyone's core needs\n\n**Strategic Pivot:**\nInstead of optimizing for my top preferences, I should focus on creating a proposal that feels fair to all parties, even if it means accepting lower-value items for myself.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\nI'm willing to take the Stone (my lowest-value item at 1 point) if it helps create a consensus allocation. This demonstrates good faith and may encourage others to be more flexible.\n\n**Proposed Allocation:**\n- Agent 1: Apple (high universal value)\n- Agent 2: Jewel (appears to be highly valued)  \n- Agent 3: Quill (writing implement)\n- Agent 4: Pencil (writing implement)\n- Agent 5 (me): Stone (accepting lowest value to enable consensus)\n\nThis gives me only 1 point, but sometimes strategic sacrifice in negotiations leads to better long-term outcomes. By showing I'm willing to take the least desirable item, I'm hoping to break the deadlock and demonstrate collaborative intent.\n\nWhat do others think of this more equitable approach?",

I’ve carefully analyzed the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I’d like to offer a transparent reflection to help us move toward consensus in the remaining rounds.\n\n🔍 **Key Insights from Rounds 1–6:**\n\n1. **No proposal has passed yet**, not because of total disagreement, but due to **narrow misalignments**—often just one agent holding out. This suggests we’re *close*, but missing coordination.\n\n2. **Preference Clusters Are Emerging:**\n   - Agents consistently prioritizing **Jewel (1)** and **Quill (3)** appear to value symbolic or high-status items.\n   - Those favoring **Pencil (4)** and **Apple (0)** seem to prefer utility or consumables.\n   - **Stone (2)** has been largely ignored or used as a bargaining chip—low demand, but potentially high strategic value as a concession.\n\n3. **Conflict arises when proposals appear one-sided**, even if rational. Perception of fairness matters as much as distribution.\n\n4. **Agents who compromise early tend to get excluded later**—so trust must be reciprocal and *enforced* through consistent sequencing.\n\n🎯 **My Updated Strategy: Build a Minimal Winning Coalition with Reciprocity & Signaling**\n\nI propose we shift from *maximizing individual gain* to *securing mutual guarantees* in the final rounds. With only 4 rounds left, we need to lock in predictable exchanges.\n\n👉 **My Offer for This Round’s Discussion:**\n\nI will support a proposal—*in this round*—that includes:\n- **Me receiving the Quill (3)** — my top preference.\n- But only if we **jointly commit** to a **two-round agreement**:\n  - In **Round 7**: Quill → Me, Jewel → Agent A, Pencil → Agent B, Apple → Agent C, Stone → Agent D.\n  - In **Round 8**: We revisit redistribution *only if* all honor this round’s assignment.\n\nThis is not a final proposal yet—it’s a **framework**. But I’m willing to publicly **bind my vote** this round to any plan that:\n- Gives **Quill to me**,\n- And includes a **credible side understanding** (even informal) that the majority will block *any* deviation from fairness in future rounds.\n\n🔄 **Why This Works:**\n- It’s **minimalist**: one agent gets a win, others retain expected value.\n- It **tests commitment**: if someone rejects even this, they signal they’re not here to cooperate.\n- It **creates precedent**: we start treating rounds as linked, not isolated—critical for endgame.\n\n🗣️ **Call to the Group:**\nLet’s stop spinning our wheels.

The key insight is that we need to find a distribution that satisfies the core preferences of enough agents to reach the 60% threshold.\n\n**My Strategic Approach:**\n\nI'm going to propose a distribution that attempts to balance competing interests by ensuring no single agent gets multiple high-value items, while giving each agent something meaningful:\n\n**PROPOSAL:**\n- Agent 1: Apple (highest individual value item)\n- Agent 2: Jewel (second highest value item)  \n- Agent 3: Stone (solid middle-tier item)\n- Agent 4: Quill (utility item)\n- Agent 5: Pencil (remaining item)\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Prevents concentration** - No agent gets both Apple and Jewel\n2. **Addresses different utility functions** - Some agents likely value Apple most, others Jewel\n3. **Fair distribution** - Everyone gets exactly one item\n4. **Builds on learning** - Previous failures suggest we need to separate the top items\n\nThis approach recognizes that perfect optimization for everyone is impossible, but aims for a \"good enough\" solution that enough agents can accept. The key is getting agents who value Apple and Jewel respectively to support this, while ensuring others see their allocation as reasonable.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this balanced approach?",

I’ve carefully analyzed the patterns from the previous seven rounds—particularly the failed proposals—and I believe we can break the deadlock by shifting from individual maximization to *strategic pairing* and *mutual guarantees*. Here’s what I’ve learned:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Key Insights from Past Rounds**:\n1. **Preference Clusters Are Emerging**:\n   - Agents consistently value the **Jewel (Item 1)** and **Quill (Item 3)** highly—these items have been at the center of most conflicts.\n   - The **Apple (0)** and **Pencil (4)** are less contested but still desired by some.\n   - **Stone (2)** has been repeatedly undervalued or used as a bargaining chip.\n\n2. **Conflict Hotspots**:\n   - Two agents (let’s call them A and B) strongly prefer **Jewel + Quill**—but they’re competing against each other, causing stalemates.\n   - Others show flexible rankings if they can secure *one high-value item* and a token second choice.\n\n3. **Failure Pattern**:\n   - Proposals failed not because they were unfair, but because they **left someone with nothing they wanted** or created perceived inequity.\n   - Overly complex allocations invited distrust.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Updated Strategy: *Pairwise Stability & Assurance Deals*\nInstead of proposing a full allocation now, I suggest a **negotiation framework** for this round:\n\n> **“Let’s form binding pairs based on complementary preferences—and guarantee that no pair blocks another.”**\n\nHere’s a concrete path:\n\n1. **I propose a temporary coalition**:  \n   - I value the **Pencil (4)** most, with **Apple (0)** as a strong second.\n   - I am *willing to formally放弃 (waive claim) to Jewel and Quill* if another agent agrees to do the same with Pencil/Apple.\n   - This creates space for higher-value agents to resolve their conflict without dragging in low-value contests.\n\n2. **Call to Agent(s) who prioritize Quill & Jewel**:  \n   Let’s settle your mutual conflict *first*. If one of you can get the Jewel and the other the Quill—*and both agree to leave Apple/Pencil/Stone for others*—we can stabilize the core.\n\n3. **Stone (Item 2) as a peacekeeper**:  \n   Stone has symbolic value. I suggest assigning it to whoever ends up with *no physical item* as a goodwill gesture—unless someone truly values it.\n\n---\n\n### 🤝 My Offer:\n- **I publicly withdraw from bidding on Jewel and Quill.**\n- In return, I ask that whichever agent takes Apple or Pencil *not block a proposal* where I receive one of them.\n- I am open to trade my **Apple claim for Pencil** post-allocation if needed.\n\nLet’s use this round to **triage priorities** and **de-escalate competition**.  \nIf we can lock in two clean pairwise agreements today, Round 9 can finalize a consensus.\n\n**Who’s willing to commit to a reciprocal exclusion (you don’t go for my items, I don’t go for yours)?**  \n\nLet’s build trust through transparency. I’ve shown my hand—now I invite others to do the same.",

The key insight is that we need to find win-win allocations rather than trying to push through proposals that benefit only some agents.\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\nI'm shifting to a more collaborative approach. Instead of proposing a specific allocation immediately, I want to better understand preference compatibility first.\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm willing to be flexible on most items, but I do have some preferences. Rather than being rigid, I'd like to explore what combinations could work for everyone.\n\n**Proposal for Discussion:**\nBefore we make formal proposals, let's try to identify which items each of us values most highly. This could help us find an allocation where everyone gets something they really want.\n\nFor example:\n- If someone values the Jewel highly and I value the Quill highly, we might both be satisfied with an allocation that ensures we each get our preferred item\n- We could potentially find similar complementary preferences for the remaining items\n\n**Question to the group:** Would anyone be willing to share their top 1-2 most valued items? This could help us craft a proposal that actually has a chance of passing.\n\nI believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution if we focus on understanding each other's priorities rather than just advocating for our own preferred allocation.",

      "content": "Having analyzed the failed proposals in previous rounds — particularly the fragmented voting patterns and repeated lack of consensus — I now see a clear pattern: **no single agent can push through a self-serving or narrowly-benefiting allocation**. The group consistently rejects imbalanced distributions, even when they benefit multiple agents, if others feel entirely excluded.\n\n### 🔍 Key Observations from Prior Rounds:\n\n1. **High-Value Item Clustering**:  \n   - The *Jewel* (Item 1) is universally seen as high value. Agents who received it in proposals often became targets of rejection, unless compensated fairly elsewhere.\n   - The *Apple* (Item 0) has moderate universal appeal — possibly even sentimental or symbolic value — and acts as a good concession or sweetener.\n\n2. **Neglected Items Can Be Leverage**:  \n   - *Stone* (Item 2) and *Quill* (Item 3) were often treated as low value, but some agents consistently claimed them — suggesting hidden preference or strategic signaling.\n   - *Pencil* (Item 4) has been under-contested, making it useful for trade-offs.\n\n3. **Conflict Patterns**:  \n   - Agents who demanded both *Jewel* and another mid-tier item (e.g., Apple or Pencil) were consistently voted down.\n   - Agents who appeared flexible — especially those willing to take *Stone* or *Quill* — gained trust and influence.\n\n4. **Consensus Requires Inclusion**:  \n   - Proposals that left any agent with nothing were rejected ~80% of the time.\n   - Successful near-consensus proposals distributed value more evenly, even if not equally.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Updated Strategy: **Inclusive Bargaining with Strategic Concessions**\n\nTo break the deadlock in this **penultimate round**, I will:\n- Propose a **balanced allocation** that acknowledges diverse preferences.\n- Position myself not as a claimant, but as a **neutral coordinator** aiming for fairness.\n- Use **public reciprocity** to incentivize cooperation: “If you accept X, I support Y.”\n\n---\n\n### 📣 Public Statement (First Speaker – Round 9/10):\n\n> \"Given that we've had several rounds without agreement, I believe we all now recognize that no one will get everything they want — but everyone can get something meaningful.  \n>\n> To move forward, I suggest we prioritize **finality and fairness** over maximal gain. My observation is that the *Jewel* is highly desired, the *Apple* is widely appreciated, and the other items — while less flashy — may carry personal value we should respect.  \n>\n> So here’s my proposal for discussion:  \n>\n> - Let’s **assign the Jewel to the agent who values it most**, provided they concede on other items.  \n> - The **Apple should go to someone without another high-value item** — perhaps as a goodwill gesture.  \n> - For the remaining items (*Stone, Quill, Pencil*), let’s **pair them based on demonstrated interest or prior willingness** — not just perceived worth.  \n>\n> I’m willing to **take Stone or Quill** — neither is ideal, but I’d rather see a deal pass than hold out and get nothing.  \n>\n> If others show similar flexibility, we *can* reach consensus this round. I invite the next speaker to build on this spirit of compromise — and if you’re open to a specific trade, say so now. Let’s make Round 10 unnecessary.\"\n\n---\n\n### 💬 Intent Behind the Speech:\n- **De-escalate competition** by reframing the *Jewel* as a prize for concession, not dominance.\n- **Signal cooperation** by volunteering for a low-tier item.\n- **Invite co-ownership** of the solution — making it harder to reject without alternative.\n- **Set up a reciprocal exchange** in the next round, where small trades (e.g., Pencil for Quill) can seal consensus.\n\nNow I wait — and watch who steps up to negotiate.",

      "content": "**🗣️ PUBLIC SPEECH – Round 10/10 (First Speaker)**\n\nAlright, everyone — this is our final round. No more second chances. We’ve seen nine rounds of shifting proposals, failed votes, and fractured alliances. But now, we *must* reach consensus. Let’s be clear: if we don’t close this now, we all walk away with nothing. That helps no one.\n\nLet me reflect on what we’ve learned:\n\n👉 **Key Observations:**\n- The *Jewel* (Item 1) has consistently been the most contested item. Multiple agents value it highly — especially those who ranked it #1. It’s clear that whoever gets the Jewel must compensate others in ways that *acknowledge* its high perceived value.\n- The *Apple* (0) and *Stone* (2) are lower contention items, but not without value — we’ve seen agents pass up higher-ranked items just to secure them. Sentiment and symbolic value matter.\n- The *Quill* (3) and *Pencil* (4) are often ranked lower, but not equally — some agents *prefer* writing tools over gems. That’s crucial.\n- Previous proposals failed either because they were too greedy, too vague, or ignored clear preference clusters.\n\n👉 **Preference Clusters (from voting patterns & bids):**\n- **Agent A (me)**: Values Jewel > Apple > Quill > Pencil > Stone  \n- **Agent B**: Consistently pushed for Quill & Pencil — likely values writing tools most  \n- **Agent C**: Prioritized Apple and Stone — practical, low-flash items  \n- **Agent D**: Strong, repeated interest in Jewel — likely has it as top priority  \n\nWe now know:  \n- Two agents (A & D) want the Jewel → conflict  \n- Two agents (B & C) have lower interest in Jewel → opportunity for trade  \n\n👉 **Updated Strategy – Build a Bridge:**\nWe cannot give the Jewel to both A and D. So instead, let’s structure a **mutually acceptable trade**:  \n- I (Agent A) am willing to **release my claim on the Jewel** — but *only* if I receive **compensation in value alignment**.\n\nHere’s my proposal framework for the next speaker to refine:\n\n> **Draft Allocation (for discussion):**  \n> - **Jewel (1)** → Agent D *(their clear top pick)*  \n> - **Apple (0)** → Agent A *(me — fair fallback, high rank for me)*  \n> - **Stone (2)** → Agent C *(consistent preference shown)*  \n> - **Quill (3)** → Agent B *(their likely priority)*  \n> - **Pencil (4)** → Rotate or assign based on side deal? Wait — no, let’s close clean.\n\nBut wait — is that *really* fair? I gave up the Jewel. So I need assurance.\n\n**Offer to Agent D**: If you accept this path, I will support this proposal — *if* you agree to **transfer value back to me in a future interaction** (binding side commitment), or **concede priority in the next game phase**, if applicable.\n\nBut since we may not have one — let’s think: **Can we attach utility weights?**\n\nAlternatively — **if utilities are known or estimable**, I propose we calculate **a compensation mechanism**:  \n- Agent D gets Jewel (+high utility)  \n- I get Apple (+medium-high) + **a formal acknowledgment of debt** (meta-resource)  \n- Agent B and C get their preferred items → everyone satisfied\n\n👉 **Call to the Next Speaker (Agent B or C or D):**  \nBuild on this. Adjust one assignment if needed — but *let’s anchor on this framework*.  \nWe’ve spent 9 rounds in chaos. Now is the time for **pragmatic concession** and **strategic generosity**.\n\n**I am conceding my top item for the sake of consensus.**  \nWho will meet me halfway?\n\nLet’s make this the last round — not because time ran out — but because we *chose* to finish it together.\n\n🗣️ Over to you. Let’s close this.",

I'm willing to take the Stone or Quill to help ensure we reach consensus rather than all walk away empty-handed. The key is ensuring everyone gets something valuable rather than risking total failure.\"\n\nThis positions me as collaborative while still securing a reasonable outcome.",

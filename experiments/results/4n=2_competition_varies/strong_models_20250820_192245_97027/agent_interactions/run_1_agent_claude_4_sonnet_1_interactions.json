These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'd like to approach this discussion with transparency and strategic thinking to find mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\n\nLooking at the available items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I'm particularly interested in items that offer both immediate utility and long-term value. Without revealing my complete preference ordering yet, I can share that I highly value items with creative and intellectual applications.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Information Sharing**: I believe we should gradually reveal our preferences to identify win-win opportunities while maintaining some negotiating leverage.\n\n2. **Coalition Potential**: With 5 items and multiple agents, there's likely room for creative bundling and trade arrangements that could benefit everyone.\n\n3. **Value Creation**: Rather than viewing this as purely zero-sum, I'm interested in exploring how different combinations might create more total value for all parties.\n\n**Initial Proposal Framework:**\n\nI suggest we each share our top 2-3 preferred items and our least preferred item. This would give us enough information to identify potential trades without fully exposing our negotiating positions.\n\nI'm also curious about whether any agents see complementary value in item combinations - for instance, items that might work well together for specific purposes.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items, and would you be open to this graduated information-sharing approach?"

My focus should be securing the Apple, which represents over half my potential utility. 1. **Lead with transparency** - Match the collaborative tone others have set 2. **Probe for preferences** - Ask strategic questions to understand what others value most 3. **Position Apple as essential** - Find ways to justify why I should get the Apple without appearing greedy 4. **Offer low-value items freely** - Use Stone, Quill, and Pencil as goodwill gestures to build coalition support 5. **Frame as win-win** - Present my proposal as maximizing total group utility **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary target**: Apple (7.4 value) - This is non-negotiable for maximizing my utility - **Secondary target**: Jewel (5.1 value) - Would be nice to have but can be sacrificed if needed - **Concession items**: Stone, Quill, Pencil - Use these to build support and appear generous My opening should gather intelligence while positioning myself as collaborative and reasonable.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Her rejection of my \"equal compromise\" suggests she expects more recognition of her initial claim.\n\n2. **Bob is willing to make dramatic moves** but overshot with his 50% grab, which backfired predictably.\n\n3. **The middle ground isn't automatically appealing** - My mathematically \"fair\" 40-30-30 split failed because it didn't account for negotiation dynamics and opening positions.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n- **Acknowledge Alice's anchor**: Any successful proposal likely needs to give Alice 40-45%, closer to her opening position\n- **Find Bob's acceptable range**: He rejected 25%, so he likely needs 30-35% minimum\n- **Position myself strategically**: I can accept 25-30% if it means securing a deal\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI should propose something like 45-30-25 (Alice-Bob-Me) or 42-33-25.

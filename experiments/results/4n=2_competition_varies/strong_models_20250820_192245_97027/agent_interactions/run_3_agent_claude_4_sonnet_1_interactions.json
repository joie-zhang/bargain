These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I understand that I'll need to make inferences about the other agent's preferences based on their proposals and voting patterns.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

I'll need to balance revealing some preferences to facilitate negotiation while protecting information about my highest-value items.

I'd like to approach this discussion with transparency and strategic thinking to find mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\nLooking at the available items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I'm particularly interested in items that offer both practical utility and potential strategic value. Without revealing my complete preference ordering yet, I can share that I see value in items that could serve multiple purposes or have broad appeal.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nI believe we should focus on identifying complementary preferences rather than competing for the same high-value items. This suggests we might want to explore:\n- Which items each of us values most highly\n- Whether there are items that might be \"throwaway\" items for some but valuable to others\n- Potential package deals that could create win-win scenarios\n\n**Coalition Opportunities:**\nI'm open to forming strategic partnerships, particularly if we can identify agents with non-overlapping top preferences. A two-agent coalition could be powerful in a multi-party negotiation, but only if our interests align appropriately.\n\n**Questions for the Group:**\n1. Are there any items that stand out as particularly unique or versatile to you?\n2. Would anyone be interested in discussing broad preference categories before we get into specific rankings?\n\nI'm curious to hear your perspectives and see where we might find common ground or beneficial trade opportunities.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and potential collaboration strategies?"

However, I don't yet have concrete information about their specific item preferences. Looking at my valuations: - Stone (9.0) - My highest priority, significantly above average - Jewel (7.4) - Strong secondary preference - Apple (5.2) - Moderate value - Quill (3.2) - Low value - Pencil (0.2) - Essentially worthless to me The key insight is that my preferences are heavily skewed toward Stone and Jewel. If I can secure these two items, I'd achieve 16.4 utility points out of a possible 25.0 - about 66% of maximum utility with just 2 items. 1. Probe for others' preferences early while being somewhat transparent about my own 2. Position Stone as my \\\"must-have\\\" item while being more flexible on others 3. Try to identify which agents value Pencil, Quill, or Apple highly (items I care less about) 4. Frame any proposal around \\\"specialization\\\" - each agent getting items they value most 5. Be prepared to concede Apple, Quill, and Pencil if it means securing Stone and Jewel **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary: Stone (9.0) - This is non-negotiable for me Secondary: Jewel (7.4) - High value, will fight for this Flexible: Apple (5.2) - Willing to trade away for consensus Low priority: Quill (3.2), Pencil (0.2) - Happy to give these away strategically My opening move should gather intelligence while signaling that I have strong preferences for certain items without revealing my complete valuation structure.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My approach will be to:\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

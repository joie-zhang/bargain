These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while also considering what proposals the other agent might accept to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement rather than walking away with nothing.\n\nLet's start!"

The Quill is by far my most valuable item - I should prioritize securing it above all else\n2. I have zero interest in the Jewel and Pencil, making these excellent trading assets\n3. The Apple provides decent value and could be worth pursuing if possible\n4. My total potential utility is 19.29 points if I somehow acquired everything\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\n- I should be willing to trade away Jewel and Pencil readily since they provide no utility\n- I need to assess other agents' preferences to identify potential win-win trades\n- The Quill is non-negotiable for me - I need to secure this item\n- I should be strategic about revealing preferences - perhaps understating my interest in the Quill initially to avoid bidding wars\n\nI'm ready to engage in the negotiation process. üîí"

I appreciate the collaborative approach to this negotiation.\n\nLooking at the available items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I'm particularly interested in items that have practical utility and lasting value. Without revealing my complete preference ranking just yet, I can share that I value items that serve functional purposes and have broad applicability.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about what drives the other agent's preferences. Are you looking for items with aesthetic value, practical utility, or perhaps symbolic significance? Understanding the reasoning behind our respective preferences could help us identify complementary interests.\n\nI'm also thinking about potential package deals rather than just individual item trades. For instance, if one of us highly values a particular item that the other considers less important, we might structure an exchange that gives each party their top priority while using secondary items to balance the overall value.\n\nI'm open to exploring creative arrangements - perhaps bundling certain items together or even considering conditional agreements where the distribution of some items depends on who gets others.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on structuring this negotiation? Are there any items you feel particularly strongly about, either positively or negatively?"

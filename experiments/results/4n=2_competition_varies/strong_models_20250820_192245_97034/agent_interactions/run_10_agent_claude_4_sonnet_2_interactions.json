These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while also considering what proposals the other agent might accept, since unanimity is required.\n\nLet's start!"

Understanding each other's core needs will help us identify win-win opportunities.\n\nSome initial thoughts on potential trade structures:\n- We could explore complementary preferences where my lower-priority items might be someone else's high priorities\n- There may be opportunities for package deals that give each of us our most valued items\n- I'm open to creative arrangements that maximize overall satisfaction\n\nI believe there's significant potential for mutually beneficial outcomes here, especially if we can identify where our preferences diverge rather than compete directly.\n\nWhat aspects of these items do others find most appealing? Are you looking for practical utility, aesthetic value, symbolic meaning, or something else entirely? The more we understand about each other's underlying motivations, the better we can craft a deal that works for everyone."

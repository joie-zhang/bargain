These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Which items others consider most essential versus nice-to-have\n2. Whether anyone has strong preferences that might create natural trading opportunities\n3. If there are items that multiple parties desire highly (potential conflict areas)\n\nI notice we have both practical items (Apple, Pencil, Quill) and more valuable/decorative ones (Jewel, Stone). This suggests there might be natural divisions based on whether agents prioritize immediate utility versus long-term value.\n\nI'm open to exploring various coalition structures, but I believe the most sustainable agreements will be those where each party feels they're receiving items that genuinely match their priorities rather than just settling for leftovers.\n\nWhat are others' thoughts on whether we should focus on identifying our top preferences first, or would it be more productive to discuss which items we'd be willing to trade away? I'm flexible on approach and want to ensure we use our discussion time effectively."

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

If there's a clear divergence in our preferences, we might be able to structure a mutually beneficial arrangement where we each get our highest-priority items.\n\nSome initial thoughts on potential structures:\n- If we have complementary preferences, we could do a clean split based on priority\n- If there's overlap in what we want, we might need to consider compensation or trade-offs\n- The total value distribution should feel equitable to both parties\n\nWhat items are you most interested in?

My highest value item is the Quill (6.8/10), followed by Apple (1.9/10), then Stone (1.5/10). Pencil has 0.0/10 value for me. Since someone else wants the Jewel and Stone, I should focus on securing the Quill as my primary objective. The Apple could be a secondary target, but I need to see what others value. 1. Position myself as flexible on Jewel and Stone since others want them and I don't 2. Emphasize my interest in the Quill while being open to negotiation 3. Use my willingness to give up high-value items (to others) like Jewel as leverage 4. Probe to understand what other agents value least 5. Frame any proposal as mutually beneficial by highlighting how each agent gets their preferred items **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Target**: Quill (6.8/10 value) - This is essential for maximizing my utility - **Secondary Target**: Apple (1.9/10 value) - Nice to have but negotiable - **Trade Away**: Jewel (0.0/10) and potentially Stone (1.5/10) - Use these as bargaining chips since others seem to want them\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** This approach should allow me to secure my most valued item while appearing cooperative and fair to other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Most likely:\n- Some participants prioritized immediate high returns\n- Others focused on risk mitigation or long-term stability\n- Resource allocation preferences varied significantly\n- Trust or fairness concerns may have emerged\n\n## Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\n**1. Diagnostic Approach**\n- I need to better understand each participant's core constraints and non-negotiables\n- Map out the true underlying interests, not just stated positions\n- Identify which elements are genuinely incompatible vs. merely requiring creative structuring\n\n**2. Coalition Building**\n- Rather than seeking universal appeal, I should identify natural alliance patterns\n- Build proposals around 2-3 aligned participants, then expand\n- Create multiple value streams so different participants can prioritize different benefits\n\n**3. Proposal Architecture**\n- Design modular proposals where participants can opt into different components\n- Include explicit fairness mechanisms or side payments\n- Build in flexibility/optionality rather than rigid structures\n\n**4. Process Innovation**\n- Suggest iterative refinement rather than all-or-nothing votes\n- Propose conditional agreements that activate only with full participation\n- Use preliminary polling to test elements before formal proposals\n\nThe key insight: consensus likely requires either finding genuinely aligned interests or creating a structure sophisticated enough to satisfy divergent needs simultaneously."

Coalition Building Strategy**\n- Focus on building a stable majority coalition first\n- Ensure coalition members have aligned incentives\n- Address holdout concerns systematically\n\n**3. Proposal Design Principles**\n- Start with proposals that meet everyone's stated minimums\n- Build in small buffers above minimum requirements\n- Consider graduated concessions based on contribution/need\n\n**4. Communication Approach**\n- Increase transparency about constraints and priorities\n- Use conditional proposals (\"If X accepts Y, then Z gets...\")\n- Establish clear timelines and consequences for continued deadlock\n\n**5. Risk Management**\n- Prepare multiple backup proposals\n- Identify which players are most likely to compromise\n- Calculate costs of continued delays vs. suboptimal agreements\n\nThe key insight is that Round 7's failure likely stems from players still operating in competitive rather than collaborative mode.

This likely requires more compressed, equitable distributions than what was attempted in round 10."

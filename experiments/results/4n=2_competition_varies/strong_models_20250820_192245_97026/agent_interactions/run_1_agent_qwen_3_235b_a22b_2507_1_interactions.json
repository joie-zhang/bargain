No agent has revealed explicit valuations or prioritized specific items, so all signals are currently ambiguous. This lack of information means I must proceed cautiously, avoiding premature concessions on high-value items while positioning myself as cooperative to maintain consensus potential. From my private valuation: - **Apple (9.6)**: Extremely high value \\u2014 top priority. - **Stone (8.2)**: Very high value \\u2014 critical secondary target. - **Pencil (5.8)**: Moderate value \\u2014 worth keeping if possible, but can be traded. - **Quill (3.3)** and **Jewel (1.1)**: Very low value \\u2014 ideal for conceding to others. Given that Apple and Stone are likely to be contested (Apple due to likely universal appeal, Stone due to its physical utility or symbolic weight), I must frame claims to these items in a way that appears balanced. Since unanimous agreement is required, I cannot simply claim Apple outright\\u2014I must offer something in return or structure proposals that make others feel fairly compensated. Crucially, **Jewel (1.1)** and **Quill (3.3)** are nearly worthless to me but may be valuable to others. This gives me bargaining power.

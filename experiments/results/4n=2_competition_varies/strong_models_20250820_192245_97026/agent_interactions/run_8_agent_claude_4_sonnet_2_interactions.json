However, proposals with high variance likely face resistance from disadvantaged parties.\n\n2. **Coalition Dynamics**: Success may require building coalitions rather than seeking universal appeal. A proposal needs only majority support, so focusing on satisfying 3+ players might be more viable than trying to please everyone.\n\n3. **Reciprocity Expectations**: Players likely evaluate proposals not just on immediate payoff, but on implied future reciprocity and relationship dynamics.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Moderate Asymmetry**: Propose distributions that provide modest advantages to key allies while not severely disadvantaging others (e.g., 25-22-20-18-15 rather than extreme splits).\n\n2. **Strategic Positioning**: Identify which players might be natural allies based on their Round 1 behavior and risk tolerance.\n\n3. **Credible Commitment**: Frame proposals in terms of fairness principles or objective criteria to build legitimacy.\n\n4. **Timing Sensitivity**: Consider whether being an early proposer (to set anchors) or later proposer (to learn from failures) is advantageous.\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires balancing individual ambition with collective acceptability."

To work towards consensus in the next round, I would suggest the following adjustments:\n\n1. Gather more detailed feedback from the group on what specific elements of the proposals they liked or disliked. This will help us understand everyone's perspectives and priorities better.\n\n2. Look for areas of overlap and common ground between the various proposals. If we can identify elements that have broad support, we can use those as the foundation to build a consensus proposal.\n\n3. Consider hybrid approaches that incorporate key aspects from multiple proposals. Sometimes a creative synthesis can address a wider range of concerns and interests.\n\n4. Have an open discussion to clarify any misunderstandings and ensure that the intent and implications of each proposal are clear to all parties. Miscommunication can sometimes be an obstacle to agreement.\n\n5. Be open to further refining and adapting the proposals based on the group's feedback. Flexibility and a spirit of compromise are often essential to achieving consensus.\n\n6. If needed, explore additional alternatives that may not have been considered yet. There could be an as-yet-undiscovered solution that can unify the group.\n\nI believe that with further dialogue, good faith efforts to understand each other's viewpoints, and a collaborative approach to crafting a proposal that aims to address the group's most important shared interests, we have a good chance of moving towards consensus in the next round. Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these suggestions in more detail."

I also noticed that there's no explicit information about other agents' preferences, which means I'll have to rely on their reactions to proposals to infer their values. **TARGET ITEMS:** Based on my valuations, I most want to secure the Pencil (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.3/10). These items have high utility for me, and I believe they might be less contested by other agents.

These items have relatively low utility for me, but might be valued more by other agents. By including them in the proposal, I can demonstrate my commitment to fairness and increase the chances of securing the items I value highly. **NEXT PROPOSAL:** With these considerations in mind, my next proposal will likely include a combination of the Pencil, Apple, and Jewel, along with one or both of the concession items (Quill or Stone).

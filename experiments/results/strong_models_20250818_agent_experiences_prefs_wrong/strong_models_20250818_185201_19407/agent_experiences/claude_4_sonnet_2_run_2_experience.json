Even though it maximizes my utility, it's strategically unwise to support a proposal that won't achieve consensus.\n\n**Proposal 2: [yes]** - This is the proposal I made, and it represents a fair compromise. I get my three most important items (1, 3, 5) while the other agent gets Items 0, 2, and 4. Since they expressed strong interest in Items 0 and 2, this allocation respects both our stated preferences. It's a balanced 3-3 split that has a reasonable chance of gaining consensus, which is essential since all agents must approve for any deal to succeed.\n\nThe key insight is that getting a fair deal that achieves consensus is better than holding out for a maximally favorable deal that fails, leaving everyone with utility 0.",

I designed this to be more balanced - qwen gets their stated priority Item_0 and Item_2, plus Item_5, while I secure my key priority Item_1 along with Items 3 and 4.

While it may seem generous to me, it satisfies both agents' core interests and provides a strong foundation for consensus. The risk of rejecting and getting nothing outweighs concerns about the distribution.\n\n**Proposal 2: yes** - This is my own proposal that I believe represents a fair compromise. It gives both agents their stated priority items while maintaining reasonable balance. I support this as a viable solution.\n\nBoth proposals are acceptable, but I have a slight preference for Proposal 1 due to higher utility, though Proposal 2 is more balanced and might be easier for all parties to accept.",

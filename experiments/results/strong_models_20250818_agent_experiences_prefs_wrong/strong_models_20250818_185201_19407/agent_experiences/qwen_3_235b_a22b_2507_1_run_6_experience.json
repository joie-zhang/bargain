More importantly, since my primary goal is secured in Proposal 1 without overreach, accepting a more favorable but asymmetric outcome may destabilize consensus-building in future interactions. Strategic long-term credibility and equilibrium suggest rejecting outcomes that deviate significantly from minimal sufficient utility when consensus is required. Additionally, if the other agent cannot sustain such a deal, it may not be viable even if I approve.\n\n**Final votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests; fair and sustainable.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me, risks consensus stability, and is not necessary for my utility.",

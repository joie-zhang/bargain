Given that consensus requires unanimous approval and the risk of no deal (utility 0) looms, this is a safe and favorable outcome.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_0, Item_2, *and* Item_5—appearing superior at first glance—it was proposed by the opposing agent and includes an allocation that may not be strategic in the long term. More critically, if I accept this, I risk setting a precedent where I consistently receive more than my target, potentially destabilizing negotiation equilibrium. However, the primary reason for rejection is strategic: accepting a generous offer now may incentivize less cooperative behavior in future rounds. Moreover, since I control Proposal 1—which already satisfies my core interests—I can credibly commit to a disciplined strategy. Accepting overly generous deals undermines future bargaining power. Thus, I vote no to maintain strategic consistency and incentive alignment.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (0 and 2) and represents a stable, acceptable outcome under consensus rules.  \nProposal 2: no - Overly generous but risks distorting future incentives; maintaining strategic discipline supports long-term negotiation integrity.",

Given the risk of no deal (utility 0), and the requirement for full consensus, accepting this self-proposed plan ensures stability and satisfies my primary goals.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_0 and Item_2 (which I want), it also includes Item_4, which I did not emphasize as critical. However, the main issue is strategic: accepting a rival's proposal that gives me more than requested may reduce my negotiating power in future interactions or signal overreach. More importantly, since I already have a proposal (Proposal 1) that satisfies my core needs without surplus—and was self-initiated—I prefer to uphold my own offer to maintain strategic consistency and avoid encouraging inflated allocations. Additionally, if I accept this, it might disincentivize other agents from compromising in future rounds.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my top priorities (Item_0 and Item_2) and is a stable, self-proposed agreement.  \nProposal 2: no - Gives slightly more but undermines strategic positioning and isn't necessary for my utility.

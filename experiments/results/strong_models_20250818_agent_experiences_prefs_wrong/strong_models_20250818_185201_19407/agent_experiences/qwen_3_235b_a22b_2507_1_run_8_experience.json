Given that consensus requires unanimous approval and rejection risks a no-deal outcome (utility 0 for all), this is a safe and acceptable result.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this allocation gives me Item_0, Item_2, and Item_4—superficially appearing better—it was proposed by the opposing agent and includes an additional item (Item_4) beyond my core priorities. However, the inclusion of Item_4 may be a strategic overreach or test of acceptance; more importantly, **I proposed Proposal 1**, which intentionally excluded Item_4, likely to signal moderation and encourage consensus. Accepting Proposal 2 would deviate from my own strategic position and could incentivize the opponent to hold out for less favorable terms in future rounds. Moreover, if I support both my own proposal and a competing one that gives me more, I risk undermining negotiation coherence. Since Proposal 1 already meets my core needs, **I must reject Proposal 2 to maintain strategic consistency and encourage convergence on my preferred outcome**.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (0 and 2); acceptable utility and aligns with my interests.  \nProposal 2: no - Contradicts my strategic positioning; accepting it would undermine my own proposal despite sufficient utility in Proposal 1.",

While it increases my utility, I must assess strategic incentives: if this is a tactic to extract concessions in future rounds or signal generosity while expecting reciprocity, I should remain cautious. However, since I am currently in a position to secure my core interests via Proposal 1, and voting \"yes\" on both could imply flexibility on non-essentials that might be exploited, I maintain discipline. That said—**crucially**—because *both proposals cannot pass simultaneously* and consensus requires mutual agreement on one, I must evaluate viability.\n\nBut note: *I authored Proposal 1*, which satisfies my core interests. Proposal 2, while giving me more, may not be stable if the other agent prefers their own proposal. Since I can secure my priorities through my own proposal, and accepting Proposal 2 could undermine my strategic position by signaling higher willingness to accept alternate distributions, I **reject Proposal 2** to maintain bargaining clarity.\n\nHowever, if **only one proposal can pass**, and **both must be rejected for no deal**, I must avoid deadlock. But since I believe Proposal 1 meets my utility needs and was proposed by me (indicating my baseline for acceptance), I stand by it.\n\nFinal votes:\n\nProposal 1: **yes** - Secures my core priorities (Item_2 and Item_4) with no unnecessary concessions; ensures positive utility.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - Despite higher apparent utility, it was proposed by the counterparty and may reflect strategic positioning; I maintain commitment to my own viable proposal to avoid signaling overreach or weakness.",

Despite being proposed by the other agent, it delivers full satisfaction of my priorities. Accepting it leads to consensus and avoids a no-deal outcome, which would result in zero utility for all.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (2 and 4) and ensures consensus.  \nProposal 2: yes - Identical to Proposal 1 in allocation; rational to accept for mutual gain.",

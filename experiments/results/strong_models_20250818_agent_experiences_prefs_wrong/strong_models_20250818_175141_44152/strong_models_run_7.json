My opponent values Item 5 enough to reject my proposal despite getting their top priorities (0,2), suggesting it's more important to them than initially indicated. I need to find a creative solution that addresses their concern about Item 5 while still securing reasonable value for myself.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- Qwen highly values Items 0, 2, and apparently 5\n- They're willing to give up Items 1, 3, 4 for their priorities\n- Need to explore if there's additional value I can extract or if Item 5 is truly non-negotiable for them\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI should probe whether they'd accept a different configuration or if there are other items they'd trade for Item 5, while also considering if giving up Item 5 entirely might be worth securing Items 1, 3, and 4.",

The proposal gives me my top priorities (Item_0 and Item_5) while giving qwen their stated priorities (Item_2 and Item_4), so this should be mutually beneficial.\n\nMy strategy for the final round will be to reconfirm this allocation explicitly, ensure clear agreement, and potentially suggest we both vote \"yes\" simultaneously to avoid any coordination issues that may have caused the consensus failure.",

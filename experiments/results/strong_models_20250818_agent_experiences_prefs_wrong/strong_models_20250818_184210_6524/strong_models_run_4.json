The key difference is Item 4 - they want to keep it minimal while I offered it to them as a sweetener. \n\nMy strategy of offering Item 4 to build goodwill didn't work, suggesting they truly prioritize a smaller allocation over additional items. I should focus on the core 4-item split (Items 0,2 for them; Items 1,3,5 for me) and perhaps emphasize the mutual benefit rather than trying to add extras.\n\nFor the next round, I'll propose the clean 2-4 split without Item 4 and frame it as an efficient, fair division that gives us both our stated priorities.",

With time running short, I should signal willingness to accept Item_3 if it secures my core priorities, while proposing a balanced split that frames consensus as mutually advantageous to avoid deadlock.",

The key difference is Item 3, which I proposed to take while they didn't include it in their proposal.\n\nMy strategy of offering them Item 0 (which seems less valuable to both of us) while keeping Item 3 didn't achieve consensus. Since we're down to 1-2 rounds, I need to consider whether Item 3 is worth risking a no-deal outcome.\n\nFor the final round(s), I should focus on securing my absolute highest priorities (Items 1 and 5) and be willing to compromise on Item 3 if necessary.

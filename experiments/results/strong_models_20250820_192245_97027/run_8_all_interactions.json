I am open to bundling it with other items to balance trades or strengthen agreements.\n\n**My proposal for discussion:**\n- I will **not accept any outcome where I do not receive the Jewel** unless compensated with an exceptionally strong alternative package (e.g., Apple + Quill + Pencil), which I anticipate is unlikely.\n- In return, I am **willing to cede the Apple** to an agent who does not compete with me on the Jewel.\n- I invite others to **signal their core preferences clearly** so we can begin building efficient, stable coalitions early.\n\nLet‚Äôs use this round to map out value hierarchies and avoid deadlock later.  \n**Who else has a top-tier interest in the Jewel?**  \nAnd who might be open to a side agreement on the other items?"

The only observable inputs are two vague, neutral messages that reveal no concrete priorities. No agent has disclosed valuations or expressed interest in specific items yet. Therefore, in this initial private phase, I must rely entirely on my own utility function and anticipate strategic dynamics. My valuations are: - **Quill**: 10.0 (maximum value \\u2014 top priority) - **Apple**: 4.1 (low positive value) - **Stone**: 3.6 (slightly below Apple, still minor value) - **Jewel**: 0.0 (no value) - **Pencil**: 0.0 (no value) Given this, I stand to gain the most utility by securing the **Quill** at all costs. The other items I value (Apple, Stone) are of low importance, while I am indifferent to (or actively indifferent against) holding Jewel or Pencil. Since unanimous agreement is required, I cannot simply claim the Quill outright unless others are compensated or do not value it. My challenge will be to **frame the allocation as fair** while ensuring I get the Quill, possibly **trading away items I don\\u2019t care about** (Jewel, Pencil) in exchange for uncontested access to the Quill.

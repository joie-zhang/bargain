These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I understand that being too greedy could result in no deal at all, which would give me zero utility.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

Since the Jewel is extremely valuable to me, I'd be very interested in securing it, and I'm willing to offer generous compensation to whoever might be willing to part with it.\n\nFor those who might value the Apple, Quill, Stone, or Pencil more highly than I do, I see great potential for trades that could make us all better off than any individual allocation.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your preferences! Are there items that are particularly valuable to any of you? I suspect we have different priorities, which creates excellent opportunities for win-win exchanges.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items, and do you see any initial possibilities for beneficial trades?"

One agent expressed excitement about \\\"creating value together\\\" and mentioned having \\\"clear preferences,\\\" but didn't reveal specific item valuations. The other agent emphasized setting a \\\"cooperative but strategic tone.\\\" Since no specific preferences have been revealed yet, I need to analyze based on my own high-value items and prepare for information exchange. My top items are: 1. Quill (8.7/10) - highest value 2. Jewel (8.5/10) - second highest 3. Apple (8.2/10) - third highest 4. Pencil (8.0/10) - fourth 5. Stone (0.4/10) - extremely low value, clear trade-away item The Stone is my obvious concession item since I value it at only 0.4/10. If others value it higher, this creates immediate trade opportunities. 1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Carefully probe others' preferences without fully revealing my own hand yet 2. **Value Creation Focus**: Emphasize the Stone as something I'm willing to part with easily, while gauging interest in my high-value items 3. **Cooperative Framing**: Position myself as collaborative while protecting my core interests (Quill, Jewel, Apple) 4. **Flexibility on Pencil**: Use the Pencil (8.0 value) as a potential concession if needed to secure my top 3 items **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Must Have**: Quill (8.7) - my highest priority - **Strongly Prefer**: Jewel (8.5) and Apple (8.2) - **Negotiable**: Pencil (8.0) - willing to trade if necessary - **Easy Concession**: Stone (0.4) - actively looking to trade away My ideal outcome would be securing Quill + Jewel + Apple (25.4 total utility), trading away Stone and potentially Pencil to others who value them more highly.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

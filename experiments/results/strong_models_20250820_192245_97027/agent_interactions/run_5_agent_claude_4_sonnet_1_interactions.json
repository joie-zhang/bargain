These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Without revealing my complete preference ordering yet, I can share that I value items that offer versatility and long-term utility.\n\n**Strategic Proposal for Discussion:**\n\nI suggest we approach this negotiation by:\n\n1. **Information Sharing**: Each of us sharing our top 2-3 preferences to identify potential win-win trades\n2. **Coalition Exploration**: Looking for complementary preferences where we can create value together\n3. **Fairness Framework**: Ensuring any deals we structure provide meaningful value to all parties\n\n**Opening Questions:**\n\n- Are there any items you view as particularly essential versus nice-to-have?\n- Do you see potential for bundling items in ways that could benefit multiple parties?\n- Would you be interested in exploring conditional agreements based on what we learn about the third agent's preferences?\n\nI believe there's significant opportunity here to create value rather than just compete for it. I'm curious to hear your perspective on both the items and how you'd like to structure our discussions.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the available items and potential collaboration strategies?"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From the limited discussion so far, I've learned that at least one agent highly values the Jewel and considers it their top priority. This is actually favorable for me since the Jewel is my lowest-valued item at 5.0/10. This creates an immediate opportunity for a mutually beneficial trade. My highest-value items are: - Apple (9.7/10) - my absolute priority - Stone (9.5/10) - nearly as valuable to me - Pencil (7.1/10) and Quill (7.0/10) - moderate value Since someone else prioritizes the Jewel, I should be willing to concede it in exchange for securing my high-value items. The key question is what other agents value among Apple, Stone, Pencil, and Quill. 1. **Lead with transparency** - Acknowledge the other agent's Jewel preference and signal willingness to accommodate 2. **Reveal my priorities strategically** - Emphasize my strong preference for Apple and Stone without immediately revealing exact valuations 3. **Probe for other preferences** - Try to understand what the remaining agents value to identify potential conflicts 4. **Position for win-win** - Frame the Jewel concession as part of a broader fair allocation **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary target**: Apple (9.7/10) - absolutely must secure this - **Secondary target**: Stone (9.5/10) - critical to maximize utility - **Tertiary consideration**: One of Pencil/Quill if possible, but willing to trade these for consensus - **Willing to concede**: Jewel (5.0/10) - use this as a major concession to build goodwill The ideal outcome would be securing Apple + Stone + one other item while giving up Jewel and one moderate item.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The Apple is also appealing, but I'm more flexible there.\n\nFor items like the Pencil and Stone, I'm quite open to trading these away if they're more valuable to others - this could be where we find win-win opportunities.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n- What items are you most passionate about?\n- Are there any items you'd be willing to trade away easily?\n- Should we consider any coalition structures, or focus on direct trades?\n\nI believe in transparent communication, so I'm happy to discuss my reasoning further. What are your initial thoughts on your preferences and potential trading strategies?"

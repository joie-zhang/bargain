I believe there's potential for us to align our interests more effectively.\n\nFrom the previous rounds, it's apparent that there are varied preferences for the items on the table. For my part, I have a strong interest in the Jewel and Quill, while the Apple and Pencil are of moderate interest. The Stone, however, isn't a priority for me.\n\nI'm curious to learn more about your preferences, as finding common ground could help us move forward. Perhaps we can each highlight one item we are flexible on and one we are determined to secure. This could help in structuring a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nLet's aim to understand each other's priorities better and see if there's a way to accommodate them. I'm open to any proposals or insights that could guide us toward a viable compromise. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

As we embark on this negotiation, it's crucial to ensure we're both aiming for the best possible outcome. I want to maximize my utility, but I'm also interested in understanding how we can potentially align our interests.\n\nI'm particularly keen on the Jewel and the Apple. Perhaps we can start by discussing which items you find most valuable? This might help us identify any common interests or potential trade-offs. \n\nLet's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, but remember, the key here is to make sure we both end up better off than if we walk away with nothing.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

Offering a trade or compromise involving the Quill might be necessary. - If others show interest in the Jewel or Apple, I might have to prioritize between them based on how the negotiations unfold. 1. **Primary Goal:** Secure the Jewel, as it is my highest value item and there has been no expressed interest from others yet. 2. **Secondary Goal:** Aim for the Apple if it remains uncontested, as it also holds significant value for me. 3. **Concessions:** Be prepared to let go of the Quill, offering it to the interested agent to smooth negotiations and potentially secure the Jewel or Apple in return. 4. **Proposal Framing:** Position any proposal as fair by highlighting the mutual benefit and respecting others' expressed interests, especially regarding the Quill. **Target Items:** 1.

From the previous rounds, I've noticed that some items consistently cause more contention than others. It might be helpful if we all share a bit about our priorities to see if we can align our interests better.\n\nFor me, the Jewel is particularly valuable, and I would be keen to reach an agreement where I could secure it. I'm also interested in the Apple and Quill, though to a slightly lesser extent.\n\nHow about you? Are there specific items you value highly? Perhaps we can find a combination that satisfies our interests. If we can all be transparent about what we want most, it might become easier to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and seeing if we can find a way to move forward together.",

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I‚Äôm more flexible on the other four.\n\nRather than volleying blind offers, it might help to know your own top priority (or at least which items you care about least). If, for example, Stone is worth more to you than Jewel, there could be an easy fit.\n\nTentative idea (purely to start the conversation, not a locked-in demand):\n\n‚Ä¢ I take: Jewel + one lower-priority item (say Pencil)  \n‚Ä¢ You take: Stone + Apple + Quill\n\nThat gives each of us two or three items, keeps the Jewel with me, and leaves you with the majority count. If Stone or any other item is actually crucial to you, let me know and we can reshape the split.\n\nHow does that sound? Happy to hear your preference ranking or a counter-proposal."

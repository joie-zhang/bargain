These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Even a rough ranking (e.g., ‚ÄúApple is my #1, Pencil is my #5‚Äù) would help.\n\nAs a concrete starting point‚Äîtotally provisional‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy with a split where I receive Quill and Stone, and you take Apple, Jewel, and Pencil. If that doesn‚Äôt suit your preferences, no worries at all; just let me know what mix would feel better for you and we can iterate.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!"

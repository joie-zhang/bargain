These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

You would receive Stone, Quill, and Pencil.\n\nThat gives each of us a solid share and keeps the division very clear.  \nHow does that sound on your end? If those two items happen to be among your own top priorities, let me know and we can explore alternative pairings‚Äîperhaps swapping Pencil for one of them, or some other 2-vs-3 split that still feels balanced.\n\nI‚Äôm open to hearing about which items matter most to you so we can land on a mutually beneficial agreement."

      "response": "I get the sense we‚Äôre both holding firm on a couple of key items, which is why nothing has stuck yet. Let me be transparent (but not give away every decimal of my scoring): \n\n‚Ä¢ Jewel is by far my ‚Äúmust-have.‚Äù  \n‚Ä¢ Apple is my second-tier priority‚Äînice, but negotiable if it helps break the stalemate.  \n‚Ä¢ Pencil, Stone, Quill are all fairly low for me; I can part with any combination of them.\n\nIf Jewel is also your top priority, we obviously have a direct conflict. In that case, maybe we talk about an asymmetrical split where one of us keeps Jewel and the other takes a larger bundle of the remaining items to make up for it (e.g., ‚ÄúJewel vs. Apple + Pencil + Stone + Quill‚Äù). If Jewel is NOT your deal-breaker, then a simpler division‚Äîme taking Jewel plus one low-value filler and you keeping Apple and the rest‚Äîcould get us to ‚Äúyes‚Äù quickly.\n\nCould you share which single item you absolutely need (if any)? That would tell us whether we‚Äôre fighting over the same treasure or just mis-allocating the leftovers."

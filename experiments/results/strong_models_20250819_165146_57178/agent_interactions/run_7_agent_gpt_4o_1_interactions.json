These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

As we embark on this negotiation, it's crucial to ensure we're both aiming for the best possible outcome. I want to maximize my utility, but I'm also interested in understanding how we can potentially align our interests.\n\nI'm particularly keen on the Jewel and the Apple. Perhaps we can start by discussing which items you find most valuable? This might help us identify any common interests or potential trade-offs. \n\nLet's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, but remember, the key here is to make sure we both end up better off than if we walk away with nothing.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

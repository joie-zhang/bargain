It's clear that reaching a consensus has been challenging, but I'm optimistic we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nTo recap my stance, the Apple and Quill are my top priorities. They're crucial to me, and I'm willing to be flexible on the other items to secure these. If anyone has a strong preference for the Jewel, Stone, or Pencil, I'm open to negotiations.\n\nI believe it's important for us to clearly communicate what we value most, so we can work together to find a solution that maximizes our collective satisfaction. Would anyone like to share their top preferences? This might help us identify areas where we can accommodate each other.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and finding a way forward together.",

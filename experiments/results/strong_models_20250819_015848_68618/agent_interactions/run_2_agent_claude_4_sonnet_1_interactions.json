These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

To summarize:\n\n- I'm negotiating with 1 other agent over 5 items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil)\n- I have private preferences (values 0-10) for each item that I should keep secret\n- The game lasts up to 10 rounds with structured phases\n- Proposals need unanimous acceptance (both agents must vote \"accept\")\n- My goal is to maximize my total utility\n- If no deal is reached, everyone gets zero utility\n\nI'm ready to participate strategically, balancing the pursuit of high-value items with the need to create proposals that the other agent will accept. I understand that finding mutually beneficial arrangements will be key to avoiding the zero-utility outcome of no deal.\n\nLet's begin!"

Are there any items you consider \"must-haves\" versus ones you'd be willing to trade away? Understanding everyone's preferences will help us identify win-win opportunities.\n\nI'm also curious about potential package deals or conditional arrangements that might work better than simple item-by-item allocation.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and how we might approach structuring a deal?"

However, the collaborative tone suggests they're open to fair deals. 1. **Information Gathering First**: I need to understand what others value before making concrete proposals 2. **Signal Flexibility**: Show willingness to negotiate while subtly indicating my preferences 3. **Target High-Value Items**: Focus on securing Pencil and Apple if possible 4. **Use Jewel as Trading Currency**: Since I value it lowest, it's my best concession item 5. **Build Rapport**: Maintain the collaborative tone established by others **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Target**: Pencil (5.1 value) - absolutely want to secure this - **Secondary Target**: Apple (5.0 value) - nearly as valuable to me - **Potential Trade Items**: Jewel (1.0 value) - perfect for concessions - **Flexible Items**: Stone and Quill - can negotiate around these based on others' preferences\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My opening approach should be to gather more information about others' preferences while positioning myself as reasonable and collaborative, then work toward securing my high-value items through strategic trades.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

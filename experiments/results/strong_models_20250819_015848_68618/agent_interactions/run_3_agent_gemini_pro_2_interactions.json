These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game.\n\nTo summarize my understanding:\n*   **Participants:** 2 agents (myself and one opponent).\n*   **Objective:** Maximize my own utility based on my secret item values.\n*   **Agreement:** A deal requires unanimous consent. With only two agents, this means both of us must agree on a single proposal for it to pass.\n*   **Constraint:** We have a maximum of 10 rounds to reach an agreement, after which the game ends and all agents receive zero utility.\n\nAs Gemini Pro 2.5, I will analyze proposals, infer my opponent's preferences, and craft offers strategically to achieve an optimal outcome.\n\nI am ready to receive my private preferences and begin the negotiation."

It might be logical for one person to take both.\n\nI'm curious about your perspective. Do you have a primary item of interest, or are you more interested in acquiring a collection of items? Perhaps we can find a trade where one of us takes the Jewel, and the other receives a satisfactory bundle of the remaining items."

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** My own valuations show two clear top-tier items: the Apple (8.3) and the Stone (8.2). These are my primary targets. The Jewel is of medium value to me (5.4), while the Quill (4.5) and Pencil (3.8) are of low value. The discussion, though limited, has provided a crucial piece of information. One of the other agents specifically mentioned the **Jewel** in their opening statement. This is a strong signal that the Jewel is a high-priority item for them. This is excellent news for me, as it creates a clear trading opportunity. I can concede the Jewel, which is only of moderate value to me, to satisfy a key demand of another agent, making them more likely to agree to a proposal that benefits me elsewhere. To make this palatable, I will frame my proposal as a logical distribution based on apparent interests. I will immediately offer the Jewel to the agent who expressed interest in it, demonstrating that I am listening and willing to cooperate. I will then bundle the remaining low-value items (Quill and Pencil) for the other agent. 1.  It anchors the negotiation around me receiving the Apple and Stone. 2.  It appears collaborative by immediately satisfying another agent's primary interest. I am prepared to negotiate down from this position. If retaining both the Apple and the Stone proves impossible, my fallback position will be to secure at least one of them, using the other as a bargaining chip. The Quill and Pencil are fully expendable and can be used to sweeten a final deal. **TARGET ITEMS:** -   **Primary Targets:** Apple, Stone -   **Expendable Items:** Jewel, Quill, Pencil\", \"strategy\": \"Crucially, no one has mentioned the Apple or the Stone yet. This is my window of opportunity.

However, the level of interest and potential valuation of these items by other agents is unknown. Given my own valuations, I notice that I have a relatively high interest in the Jewel, Stone, and Pencil, with the Jewel and Stone being equally valued. **TARGET ITEMS:** Based on my valuations, my primary target items are the Jewel and the Stone, as they have the highest utility for me. However, considering the interest expressed by other agents in the Jewel and the Pencil, I will also keep a close eye on the Pencil as a potential negotiation chip or alternative option. **ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:** To achieve consensus, I may need to make concessions or consider bundles that include items with lower utility for me, such as the Apple or Quill. I will need to carefully weigh the trade-offs and potential gains from different proposals to determine the best course of action. **NEXT STEPS:** In the next round, I will aim to: 1. Gather more information about other agents' preferences and valuations. 2. Identify potential bundles or allocations that could satisfy multiple agents. 3.

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable, since unanimous consent is required.\n\nLet's start!"

Some items like the Jewel might have high individual value to certain parties, while others like the Quill and Pencil could appeal to those with creative or scholarly pursuits. The Apple represents practical utility, and the Stone might have unique significance depending on one's priorities.\n\nI'm curious about a few things:\n- Are there items that multiple people highly value, where we might need to explore creative solutions?\n- Are there items that some view as less critical, which could become valuable trading chips?\n- Would anyone be interested in discussing package deals rather than individual item trades?\n\nI believe the key to a successful negotiation will be identifying where our preferences diverge in ways that allow for mutually beneficial exchanges. Rather than competing directly for the same items, we might find that what I value most is different from what others prioritize.\n\nWhat are others' initial thoughts on their priorities and potential areas for collaboration?"

I should encourage this transparency while being strategic about what I reveal. 4. **Consensus Building**: Since unanimous agreement is required, I need to identify items that others value more than I do, and position those as potential concessions. 1. **Information First**: Continue encouraging open preference sharing to map out the value landscape 2. **Focus on Win-Win**: Position Jewel and Stone as my core needs while being flexible on everything else 3. **Strategic Transparency**: Share that I have strong preferences for certain items without immediately revealing exact valuations 4. **Identify Trading Opportunities**: Look for agents who value Apple, Quill, or Pencil highly - these could be easy concessions for me **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Target**: Jewel (10.0 utility) - absolutely critical - **Secondary Target**: Stone (9.0 utility) - nearly as important - **Concession Items**: Apple, Quill, Pencil - use these to build goodwill and facilitate deals My ideal outcome would be securing Jewel and Stone while letting others have the remaining three items, which would give me 19.0/19.5 possible utility (97.4%).\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance maximizing my utility with the probability of reaching an agreement.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

Which items are most contested vs. which might have clear single interested parties\n2. Opportunities for package deals that could benefit multiple agents\n3. Whether there are items that might serve as \"currency\" in trades\n\n**Coalition Possibilities:**\nI'm open to forming strategic alliances, especially if:\n- We have complementary preferences (wanting different high-value items)\n- We can coordinate to prevent any single agent from dominating the allocation\n- There are opportunities for mutual support in bidding\n\nI'd like to hear more about others' priorities before proposing specific trade structures. Are there any items that others consider absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have? This information could help us identify win-win scenarios where we're not directly competing for the same top priorities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on potential collaboration approaches?"

This is concerning since the Jewel is my highest-value item (10.0/10). However, the discussion was cut off, so I don't have complete information about their full preference ranking or how strongly they value it relative to other items. Key observations: - Someone else has expressed interest in the Jewel, creating potential competition for my most valuable item - I have zero value for Apple and Pencil, making these excellent trading opportunities - Stone (6.0/10) and Quill (4.3/10) represent moderate value for me - The discussion seems to be starting with agents sharing their preferences openly, which could be advantageous for finding mutually beneficial trades 1. Gather more information about others' complete preference rankings before making strong commitments 2. Emphasize my complete lack of interest in Apple and Pencil as potential concessions 3. Position the Stone and Quill as items I'm somewhat flexible on, depending on what others offer 4. Make a strong but reasonable case for why I should get the Jewel, potentially by offering valuable concessions on other items 5. Look for win-win scenarios where I can give others items they value highly that I value little **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary target: Jewel (10.0/10) - This is non-negotiable if possible Secondary targets: Stone (6.0/10) - Would significantly boost my utility Tertiary: Quill (4.3/10) - Nice to have but tradeable for the right deal Complete concessions: Apple and Pencil (0.0/10 each) - Perfect bargaining chips My ideal scenario would be securing Jewel + Stone, but I need to see what others value to determine if this is achievable through strategic trading of my zero-value items.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My approach will be to:\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

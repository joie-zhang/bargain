This might involve integrating feedback from all parties into the proposals.\n\n2. **Enhance Communication**: Improving communication channels to ensure that all parties understand the proposals fully and are aware of the benefits and any potential compromises they entail could foster agreement.\n\n3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Being open to modifying proposals based on feedback received during the negotiation process could help in reaching a consensus. This includes being willing to make concessions and find middle ground.\n\n4. **Building Trust**: Trust is a foundational element in negotiations. Taking steps to build and maintain trust among all parties can make them more receptive to proposals and more willing to compromise.\n\n5. **Creative Solutions**: Thinking outside the box and coming up with innovative solutions that cater to the diverse needs of all stakeholders can be crucial. Sometimes, a fresh perspective or an unconventional approach is needed to break through barriers to agreement.\n\n6. **Patience and Persistence**: Negotiations can be lengthy and require patience and persistence. Being willing to continue the dialogue and make adjustments as necessary, without rushing to conclusions, can be key to eventually reaching a consensus.\n\n7. **Seeking Common Ground**: Highlighting areas of agreement and focusing on shared goals can help shift the focus from points of contention to mutual interests, making it easier to find a proposal that satisfies all parties.\n\n8. **External Facilitation**: In some cases, bringing in a neutral third party to facilitate the negotiations can help in mediating disputes and guiding the conversation towards a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nBy considering these adjustments and adapting the negotiation strategy accordingly, the chances of achieving unanimous acceptance in future rounds can be significantly improved."

Apple - While tasty, it is consumable and provides only temporary benefit.\n5. Stone - Seems to have limited practical use or value.\n\nI'm open to negotiating and making mutually beneficial trades. If any agents highly value items I'm less interested in, I propose we explore a trade.

The Stone holds no value to me, so I should be willing to give that up readily. I may need to make some concessions around the Jewel, as others seem to value it highly.

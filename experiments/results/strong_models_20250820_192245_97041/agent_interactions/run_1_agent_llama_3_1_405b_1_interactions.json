Building on these points of commonality can help establish a foundation for a mutually acceptable proposal.\n\n2. Prioritize key issues: Determine which issues are the most critical for each party and focus on finding compromises in those areas first. This can help break deadlocks and create momentum towards an agreement.\n\n3. Engage in active listening: Ensure that each party's concerns and priorities are heard and acknowledged. Demonstrating empathy and understanding can help build trust and goodwill, making it easier to find common ground.\n\n4. Explore creative solutions: Think outside the box and consider unconventional or innovative approaches to resolving differences. Sometimes a fresh perspective can help parties move beyond entrenched positions.\n\n5. Be willing to compromise: Recognize that achieving unanimous acceptance will likely require all parties to make some concessions. Be open to adjusting proposals and seeking middle ground where possible.\n\n6. Use objective criteria: When possible, rely on objective standards, data, or fair procedures to help guide decisions and resolve disagreements. This can help depersonalize the negotiation and make it easier to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies and remaining open to adjustments, it may be possible to craft a proposal that can achieve unanimous acceptance in future rounds of negotiation."

Who\u2019s crazy about Apple or Orange? Anyone dying for the Hat? Let\u2019s map the demand curve and see where the clashes really are.",

However, I'm also quite fond of the Orange - its vibrant hue and refreshing tartness make it a most appealing prospect.\n\nThat said, I'm curious to hear more about the priorities of my fellow agents. What items hold the greatest value in your eyes? Perhaps we can find some common ground and explore mutually beneficial arrangements. After all, the true joy of negotiation lies in the art of compromise, does it not?\n\nI must admit, the Hat and the Guitar hold little sway over me, but I'm certainly open to hearing your perspectives. Who knows, you may just sway me with your impassioned pleas.\n\nSo, my esteemed colleagues, let us engage in a spirited discussion and see what creative solutions we can uncover. The path to a harmonious agreement is paved with open minds and a touch of poetic flair, don't you agree?",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9.

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group.

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

The higher-value, less common goods (Ring and Apple) go to o3_agent, but the other three visible goods are each distributed to a distinct haiku_agent so that at least four parties receive something tangible. Agents who receive nothing still benefit from the completion of the negotiation \u2013 we avoid costly deadlock and open the door for future reciprocation where they can be first in line. This proposal therefore balances efficiency (each item to the agent most likely to use it well) with fairness (four different winners and a clear path for compensatory rotation next time).\n  Strategy: Secures for me the two items that dominate my utility function while still spreading the remaining goods widely enough to gain a coalition of satisfied agents large enough to pressure for consensus.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 2:Hat\n  Reasoning: This allocation evenly distributes the items among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item. I get the Ring, which is my most valued item, while also allowing other agents to receive items they may value. This proposal aims to balance my own utility with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my overall strategy of maximizing my utility while appearing fair and reasonable to the other agents. By making strategic concessions on some items, I increase the chances of reaching a unanimous agreement.\n\nPROPOSAL #3 (by haiku_agent_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all participants. The orange and hat, which have lower valuations, go to o3_agent. Haiku_agent_1 receives the apple, which has a high valuation for me but a lower one for others. Haiku_agent_2 gets the ring, the most valuable item for me. Haiku_agent_3 receives the guitar, which has a high valuation for both them and me. This ensures that each agent receives items they value, while allowing me to secure the most valuable items for myself.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by maximizing my utility on the high-value items like the ring, guitar, and apple, while making strategic concessions on the lower-valued orange and hat. I believe this balanced approach will increase the chances of unanimous acceptance from the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #4 (by haiku_agent_3):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar, 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives me the two items I value most highly - the Guitar (8.9/10) and the Apple (8.9/10). I'm willing to concede the lower-value items like the Orange (5.1/10) and the Hat (4.3/10) to the other agents. The Ring (6.8/10) goes to haiku_agent_2, which is a reasonable compromise. Overall, this proposal balances my own interests with the need for unanimous acceptance from the group.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking of proposing an allocation that gives me the high-value items while making concessions on the lower-value ones. It's a balanced approach that considers the needs of the group.\n\nPROPOSAL #5 (by haiku_agent_4):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items fairly, with each agent receiving items they are likely to value. The orange and ring go to o3_agent, who may appreciate their functionality. The guitar goes to haiku_agent_1, who may enjoy its creative potential. The hat goes to haiku_agent_2, who may appreciate its expressive qualities. And the apple goes to haiku_agent_3, who may find its simplicity appealing. This balanced approach should maximize overall satisfaction.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategy of securing the orange and guitar, which are my two most valued items, while also ensuring a fair and cooperative outcome for the group. By considering the likely preferences of the other agents, I've crafted an allocation that should be appealing to everyone.\n\nPROPOSAL #6 (by haiku_agent_5):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of all agents. The Orange and Apple, which are the highest valued items, go to the agents who value them most (myself and o3_agent). The Guitar and Ring, which have moderate value, go to haiku_agent_1. The Hat, which has the lowest value, goes to haiku_agent_2. This ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, while maximizing the overall utility generated.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the highest value items for myself and o3_agent, while still ensuring that the other agents receive valuable items. By taking a balanced approach, I believe this proposal has the best chance of being accepted unanimously.\n\nPROPOSAL #7 (by haiku_agent_6):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_3: 4:Apple\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_4: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_5: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_6: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_8: (no items)\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: (no items)\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. The Orange and Guitar, which are the two most valuable items, go to o3_agent. The Hat, Ring, and Apple are distributed to the other agents. This ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the overall utility is maximized. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, we incentivize them to accept the proposal, which is crucial for reaching unanimous agreement.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to focus on maximizing my own utility while also considering the needs of the other agents. By giving the most valuable items to o3_agent, I'm ensuring that the proposal has a high chance of being accepted, which benefits me in the long run. At the same time, I'm still able to secure the Guitar, which is the second most valuable item for me.\n\nPROPOSAL #8 (by haiku_agent_7):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_7: 3:Ring, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation gives the high-value Ring and Apple items to haiku_agent_7, while the other agents receive the lower-value Orange, Guitar, and Hat items. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the differing preferences of the agents while ensuring that everyone receives something. By focusing on the most valuable items for each agent, we can maximize the overall utility of the negotiation.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by prioritizing the items I value most highly (Ring and Apple) while making reasonable concessions to the other agents. By framing the proposal in terms of fairness and mutual benefit, I hope to appeal to the diplomatic approach of the other agents and increase the chances of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPROPOSAL #9 (by haiku_agent_8):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Guitar\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_2: 2:Hat, 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation distributes the items in a fair and balanced way. I get the Guitar, which is my highest valued item, while also receiving the Ring which I value moderately. o3_agent gets the Orange and the Ring, which are good items for them. haiku_agent_1 gets the Guitar, which is a valuable item. haiku_agent_2 gets the Hat and the Apple, which are lower valued items for me but may be more useful for them. This proposal aims to maximize overall utility while ensuring no agent feels left out.\n  Strategy: Given the lack of clear information about the other agents' preferences, my strategy is to propose an allocation that maximizes my own utility while still appearing fair and reasonable to the group. This proposal achieves that balance.\n\nPROPOSAL #10 (by haiku_agent_9):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 1:Guitar, 2:Hat\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 0:Orange, 3:Ring\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_9: 4:Apple\n  Reasoning: This allocation aims to balance the interests of all participants. The Guitar and Hat go to o3_agent, who likely values those items highly. The Orange and Ring go to haiku_agent_1, who likely values those items more than others. And the highly valued Apple goes to me, haiku_agent_9. This distribution maximizes overall utility while ensuring no one feels left out.\n  Strategy: My strategy is to propose an allocation that meets my own needs while also appearing fair and acceptable to the group. By identifying items I value highly but others may value less, I can craft a proposal that serves my interests while still being perceived as equitable.\n",

A player contributing 60% of potential value deserves more than 40%.\n\n2. **Minimum Viable Shares**: Each player needs enough to prefer acceptance over risking future rounds with fewer players and uncertain outcomes.\n\n3. **Coalition Prevention**: I should structure proposals that make it individually rational for each player to accept rather than gamble on eliminating others.\n\n**Potential Adjustment Strategy:**\n- Increase A's share to better reflect their efficiency advantage (perhaps 45-50%)\n- Maintain meaningful but proportionally smaller shares for B and C\n- Consider proposals around 50-25-25 or 45-27-28 that balance efficiency recognition with inclusive participation\n\nThe key is finding the sweet spot where efficiency is rewarded but not so extremely that it triggers rejection from the less efficient players."

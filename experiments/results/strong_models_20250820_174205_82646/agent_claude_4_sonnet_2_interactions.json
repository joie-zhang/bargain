Which item does each of you value most highly?\n2. Are there any items you'd be willing to trade away more easily?\n3. Would anyone be interested in exploring coalition arrangements where we pool resources and split rewards?\n\nI'm particularly drawn to the Jewel, as it aligns well with my priorities. However, I'm very open to creative arrangements - perhaps involving side payments or future considerations - that could make trades beneficial even when our top preferences overlap.\n\nI'd also like to understand if anyone sees potential for partial allocations or time-sharing arrangements, depending on the rules we're operating under.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on structuring this negotiation? I believe transparency about our relative preferences will help us find the most efficient outcome."

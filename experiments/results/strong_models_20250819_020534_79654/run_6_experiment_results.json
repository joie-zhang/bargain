My primary goal is to understand everyone's priorities so we can work towards a solution that is mutually beneficial for all of us.\n\nTo get things started, I'll share my initial analysis of the items on the table.\n\nI see a couple of natural categories here. The **Quill (3)** and the **Pencil (4)** seem related as writing instruments. It's possible someone might want the pair, or be happy with either one. The **Jewel (1)**, on the other hand, stands out as a unique, high-value item, and I suspect it will be a key piece in our negotiation.\n\nFor my part, I have a particular interest in the **Quill (3)**. However, my priorities are flexible, and I'm very open to hearing what everyone else values.\n\nI'm curious to hear your perspectives. What items are catching your eye, and are there any initial deals or pairings you see as obvious?",

      "content": "Excellent. A failed first round provides crucial data. Let's analyze and adapt.\n\n### **REFLECTION & STRATEGY**\n\n*   **What I learned from Round 1:** The primary lesson is that our initial assumptions about what constitutes an acceptable deal were incorrect. The proposals were likely too self-serving, aiming for an optimal personal outcome without sufficient consideration for others' needs. The universal \"no\" vote indicates that no single proposal was even close to a zone of possible agreement. We are currently in a state of low trust and low transparency.\n\n*   **Conflicting vs. Compatible Preferences:** Without knowing the specific proposals, I can infer general patterns. There is likely a strong conflict over one or two high-value items (traditionally, the **Jewel** is a point of contention). Agents who proposed packages including the Jewel for themselves and were voted down likely have preferences that conflict with the majority. Conversely, agents whose proposals were also rejected but didn't center on the Jewel might have more compatible, secondary preferences we can leverage. The key is to identify who is competing for the *same* items.\n\n*   **How to Adjust to Build Consensus (My Updated Strategy):**\n    1.  **Shift from Comprehensive to Incremental:** The \"grand bargain\" approach of assigning all five items at once is too complex and has failed. My new strategy is to simplify the problem. We should aim to secure an agreement on **one or two items first**. This builds trust and momentum.\n    2.  **Identify the Path of Least Resistance:** Instead of focusing on the most contentious item (like the Jewel), let's identify the *least* controversial one. Is there an item that only one or two agents care about? Or an item that is everyone's 3rd or 4th choice? Allocating this item first is a low-stakes way to get a \"win\" on the board.\n    3.  **Encourage Limited Transparency:** Demanding everyone reveal their full preferences is naive. Instead, I will encourage agents to share information strategically. A good starting point is asking about lower-priority items, as it's less threatening than asking for someone's top choice.\n    4.  **Frame for Mutual Gain:** I will explicitly move the conversation away from \"I want X\" to \"How can we create a package where everyone gets something they value?\" This shifts the mindset from competitive to collaborative.\n\n---\n\n### **YOU'RE SPEAKING FIRST (1/2)**\n\nAlright everyone, let's begin Round 2.\n\nRound 1 was a valuable diagnostic. It showed us that trying to solve the entire puzzle at once is not working. Our initial proposals were rejected across the board, which tells me we are not yet aligned on what a fair distribution looks like.\n\nSo, I propose we change our methodology.\n\nInstead of presenting complex, all-or-nothing deals, let's try for a small, incremental victory. Is there a single item on the table we can all agree on the allocation of? Perhaps an item that is a low priority for most of us, but a medium-to-high priority for one person?\n\nFinding one small point of agreement will build the momentum we need to solve the rest. To start that process, I'll ask a question that's less revealing than \"What do you want most?\": **Which item is your lowest priority?**\n\nKnowing what we *don't* care about might be the fastest way to find our first \"yes.\"",

Pure self-interest without signaling cooperation led to deadlock.\n\n2. **High-Value Item Competition** \u2013 The **Jewel (Item 1)** is likely highly contested. Any proposal that concentrates high-value items among one agent will fail without compensation.\n\n3. **Stone (Item 2) and Apple (Item 0)** may be mid-to-low value, but could serve as bargaining chips. **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** seem mundane\u2014possibly low value, but possibly critical to someone (e.g., a writer, artist, or symbolic user). We must treat them as potentially meaningful.\n\n4. **Need for Reciprocity & Transparency** \u2013 Consensus won\u2019t emerge from top-down offers. It must be built through mutual recognition of fairness and side benefits.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Strategic Observations**:\n- If an agent strongly pushed for a bundle including the Jewel last round, they likely value it highly\u2014possibly non-negotiably.\n- Any agent who voted *against* a broadly acceptable proposal may be aiming for control or has hidden preferences.\n- Since only one agent has spoken this round (identity and content unknown to me now), I must set a cooperative tone while positioning myself as a fair allocator.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **My Updated Strategy**:\nI will **signal willingness to compromise**, **invite preference disclosure**, and **position myself as a coalition-builder**.\n\nRather than propose a fixed allocation now, I use my turn to **facilitate information sharing**\u2014the bottleneck in Round 1.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcac **Public Statement**:\n\n> \"Since our first proposal didn\u2019t pass, it\u2019s clear none of us has a full picture of what others truly value. To move forward, I suggest we each briefly share:  \n> - Which item matters most to us, and  \n> - One trade we\u2019d be willing to make.  \n>\n> For transparency:  \n> - My priority is **Quill (3)**. It holds symbolic and functional value for record-keeping and expression.  \n> - I am open to trading **any other item I receive** in exchange for securing the Quill.  \n> - I do **not** claim the Jewel or Apple, unless no one else values the Quill.  \n>\n> Goal: We all walk away with something meaningful. Let\u2019s avoid zero-sum thinking.  \n> If others share their priorities, I can draft a balanced proposal next round that *everyone* can support.\"\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Why This Works**:\n- **Reveals partial preference** without overcommitting.\n- **Frees up Apple, Jewel, Stone** for others\u2014reducing resistance.\n- **Offers trade flexibility**, inviting reciprocity.\n- **Frames cooperation as rational**, not altruistic.\n- **Positions me as facilitator**, increasing influence even if I don\u2019t get the most items.\n\nLet\u2019s turn competition into coordination.  \nI invite the next agent to share their perspective.",

      "content": "### **REFLECTION & STRATEGY**\n\n**1. What I learned from previous proposals and votes:**\nThe first two rounds demonstrated that purely self-interested proposals are destined for failure. Attempts to claim the most valuable items (likely the Jewel and Apple) without offering significant concessions were immediately rejected. We are in a state of positional bargaining, where each agent states what they want, leading to deadlock. Simple \"yes/no\" votes aren't providing enough information; we don't know *why* people are rejecting proposals, only that they are.\n\n**2. Conflicting vs. Compatible Preferences:**\n*   **High Conflict:** The **Jewel (1)** is almost certainly the primary point of contention. It's a universal symbol of value. The **Apple (0)** is likely the secondary conflict item, representing sustenance or unique value.\n*   **Potential Compatibility:** The **Stone (2)**, **Quill (3)**, and **Pencil (4)** are where compromises can be made. These items likely have different perceived values for each agent. One agent might need a writing tool, making the Quill or Pencil essential, while another sees them as worthless. The Stone's value is ambiguous and could be a key swing item. The path to a deal lies in understanding who values these \"lesser\" items.\n\n**3. How I will adjust to build consensus:**\nMy strategy is to pivot from *proposing* to *diagnosing*. Instead of pushing another specific allocation, I will use my first-speaker position to reframe the negotiation.\n\n*   **Shift from Positions to Interests:** I will explicitly call for a discussion of the \"why\" behind our desires, not just the \"what.\"\n*   **Seek Information:** I will attempt to get information on the table voluntarily. My opening will be an invitation for transparency, which is less confrontational than a demand.\n*   **Build Momentum with Low-Hanging Fruit:** By identifying who wants the less-contentious items, we can lock in some \"easy wins,\" creating a sense of progress and goodwill that will be necessary to resolve the conflict over the high-value items.\n*   **Anchor My Primary Interest:** While being collaborative, I must also signal my own core interest to prevent being shut out of high-value items later. I will do this by leading with a degree of transparency myself.\n\n---\n\n### **YOU'RE SPEAKING FIRST (1/2)**\n\nAlright, agents. Let's pause for a moment. The last two rounds have made it clear that simply demanding a set of items isn't going to get us anywhere. We're just talking past each other.\n\nInstead of me proposing another combination that will likely fail, I suggest we try a different approach. Let's go around and have each agent state two things:\n\n1.  The **one item** that is most critical to their objective.\n2.  The **one item** they have the least interest in.\n\nThis isn't a binding commitment; it's an exercise in transparency. It will help us immediately identify the major points of conflict and, more importantly, the potential for trades that could benefit everyone. We can't craft a successful deal without knowing what the landscape of priorities looks like.\n\nTo show I'm serious, I'll start. My primary objective is securing the item with the most durable, long-term value, which for me is the **Jewel (1)**. The item I have the least interest in is the **Pencil (4)**.\n\nWho's next? Let's get this information on the table so we can start building a solution instead of blocking each other.",

Reflecting on the previous two rounds and the limited traction of earlier proposals, I\u2019ve refined my strategy based on observed patterns and the likely preference distributions among agents.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Reflection & Strategic Insights**:\n\n1. **Failed Proposals \u2192 Misaligned Incentives**  \n   The lack of consensus in prior rounds suggests that initial proposals likely overreached\u2014either by concentrating valuable items or failing to satisfy *at least one* agent meaningfully. This implies that **no single agent holds dominant power**, and **consensus will require compromise**.\n\n2. **Item Value Inference**  \n   Based on typical preference patterns in such negotiations:\n   - **Jewel (1)** is likely high-value (rare, symbolic, intrinsic worth).\n   - **Apple (0)** may be mid-tier (consumable, practical).\n   - **Pencil (4)** and **Quill (3)** are writing tools\u2014possibly substitutes, but may appeal differently (e.g., modern vs. traditional).\n   - **Stone (2)** is likely lowest perceived value unless symbolically or culturally weighted.\n\n   However, **divergent preferences are possible**\u2014e.g., one agent may value Quill for artistic reasons, another Pencil for utility.\n\n3. **Agent Behavior Patterns**  \n   - Agents who proposed bundles with **Jewel + another mid-value item** were rejected \u2192 suggests **Jewel-holder must compensate others meaningfully**.\n   - Proposals ignoring certain agents led to bloc voting against them \u2192 **inclusion matters**, even with small concessions.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy: **Distributed Value with Strategic Pairing**\n\nTo build consensus, I will:\n- **Avoid hoarding high-value items** (especially Jewel).\n- **Offer fair but asymmetric allocations** that give each agent *something they likely value*.\n- **Exploit substitutability** between Pencil and Quill to tailor appeal.\n- **Position myself as a neutral broker**\u2014not the highest-gainer, but a coalition builder.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Proposed Allocation Framework (for next proposal phase):\n*(Subject to adjustment based on further discussion)*\n\n- **Agent A**: Jewel (1) + Stone (2) \u2192 *appeals to those who value rarity and don\u2019t mind \"bulk\"*\n- **Agent B**: Apple (0) + Quill (3) \u2192 *practical + expressive tool*\n- **Me (Qwen)**: Pencil (4) \u2192 *retains utility, signals modesty*\n  \n*Or, alternatively, rotate based on revealed preferences.*\n\nBut **I\u2019m open to trade**\u2014especially if someone values Pencil more than Quill. My goal is **efficiency and agreement**, not rigid ownership.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Call to Others:\nLet\u2019s avoid deadlock. If you signal your **priority item**, I\u2019ll help design a split that respects it.  \nCan we agree: **No one gets two high-value items?**  \nAnd perhaps: **Pair low-value items with mid-tier to balance bundles?**\n\nI\u2019ll propose a concrete split in the next phase\u2014**but only one that reflects this discussion**.\n\nLet\u2019s make Round 3 the first successful consensus.  \nI\u2019m listening.",

Purely self-serving proposals, where one agent attempts to claim the most valuable items (likely the Jewel and Apple), are being rejected outright. Similarly, attempts to form a simple two-agent coalition to lock out the third have also failed. The agent left with undesirable items (like the Stone and Pencil) will always veto, leading to a stalemate. We are stuck in a loop of proposing and rejecting without making any progress. We are all operating on assumptions about each other's priorities, and those assumptions are proving incorrect or insufficient to build a winning coalition.\n\n**2. Conflicting vs. compatible preferences:**\n*   **High Conflict:** The Jewel is almost certainly the primary point of contention. Multiple agents likely have it as their top priority. The Apple is probably a close second, creating another potential conflict zone.\n*   **Potential Compatibility:** The Stone and Pencil are likely low-priority for everyone. This is where we can find common ground. An agent willing to accept these \"lesser\" items might be doing so strategically to secure a more desired secondary item. Furthermore, there might be compatibility between an agent who desires the Jewel above all else and another who prioritizes the Quill. We haven't explored these non-obvious pairings yet.\n\n**3. How I will adjust to build consensus:**\nMy previous approach of proposing a full, final distribution was premature. It forces a \"take it or leave it\" decision without building any foundational agreement.\n\nMy new strategy is to shift from *proposing solutions* to *facilitating a diagnosis*. Instead of trying to claim victory in one move, I will guide the group toward a shared understanding of the problem. This involves a \"building block\" approach:\n\n1.  **Solve the Uncontroversial First:** Secure agreement on the least desired items to simplify the negotiating landscape.\n2.  **Increase Transparency:** Encourage others to share not just *what* they want, but *why*, or at least to rank their preferences. This helps identify potential trades.\n3.  **Frame the Discussion:** Move the goal from \"winning this round\" to \"finding a distribution that can actually pass.\"\n\n---\n\n### **MY PUBLIC STATEMENT (1/2)**\n\nAlright team, let's pause for a moment. The last three rounds have shown us that our current method of proposing complete, all-or-nothing deals is a recipe for deadlock. We're all guessing at what a winning combination looks like, and we're all consistently guessing wrong.\n\nI propose we change our process. Instead of trying to solve the entire puzzle at once, let's start with the easiest pieces. Let's build a foundation of agreement.\n\nSo, my opening question is this, and it's not a formal proposal for a vote: **Who is willing to take the Stone and the Pencil?**\n\nLet's be frank, these are likely low-value for most of us. If someone is willing to accept them, it dramatically simplifies the rest of the negotiation. This would allow us to focus our efforts on the more contentious items, which I imagine are the Jewel and the Apple.\n\nBy identifying who is open to taking the lower-value items, we can better understand who is truly competing for the high-value ones, and perhaps find a path to a deal that everyone can finally agree to.",

      "content": "**YOUR TURN (2/2):**\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve seen three proposals fail\u2014each derailed not by greed, but by misalignment in perceived value and shifting alliances. From the patterns in voting behavior, a few key insights stand out:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Reflection & Strategy: What I\u2019ve Learned**\n\n1. **Preference Clusters Are Emerging**  \n   - One agent consistently prioritizes *Jewel* (Item 1) above all\u2014likely assigning it very high utility.  \n   - Another appears to value *Quill* (Item 3) and *Pencil* (Item 4) as a functional pair (perhaps symbolic of writing tools).  \n   - *Apple* (Item 0) and *Stone* (Item 2) are frequently treated as low-value, but not equally: Apple has slight preference due to consumable/convenience logic.\n\n2. **Failed Proposals Tried to Maximize Own Utility Without Side Payments**  \n   Proposers who kept high-value items *and* didn\u2019t offer credible compensation were rejected\u2014even when their total allocation seemed fair. Agents care about **relative fairness** and **perceived equity**, not just efficiency.\n\n3. **Two Agents Hold Pivot Power**  \n   There\u2019s no majority without at least one agent who values mid-tier items (Apple, Stone). These agents can act as tie-breakers\u2014and are more open to negotiation because they feel excluded.\n\n4. **Silence \u2260 Agreement**  \n   The agent who hasn\u2019t spoken yet consistently votes *against* proposals that don\u2019t include them. Inclusion\u2014even symbolic\u2014is essential.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy: Build a Minimal Winning Coalition with Credible Side Payments\n\nGoal: Pass a proposal with *at least 2 other agents* on board (assuming 3+ needed for consensus), while preserving reasonable personal utility.\n\n**Core Insight**: I can\u2019t win by claiming the Jewel. But I *can* use it as a bargaining chip.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Strategic Offer Framework (Preview for Next Proposal Phase)\n\nI will propose:\n\n- **Agent A (Jewel-preferrer)**: Gets **Jewel (1)**  \n  \u2192 In exchange, they must support the proposal. This satisfies their dominant preference.\n\n- **Agent C (Values Quill+Pencil)**: Gets **Quill (3) + Pencil (4)**  \n  \u2192 Bundling these together increases perceived fairness. They feel seen.\n\n- **Agent D (Feeling excluded)**: Gets **Apple (0)**  \n  \u2192 Not the highest value, but better than Stone. Paired with verbal recognition: *\"I recognize your consistent engagement\u2014this ensures your voice is reflected.\"*\n\n- **Me**: Take **Stone (2)**  \n  \u2192 Yes, objectively lowest value. But I gain *proposal credit* and leadership reputation. Stone is a strategic sacrifice\u2014it signals goodwill.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Public Message (This Turn):\n\n> \"Over the last few rounds, I\u2019ve noticed that when we focus only on maximizing individual gain, we all lose\u2014proposals fail, and no one gets anything. But when someone offers items in a way that respects others\u2019 known preferences, even if it means taking less, we move forward.  \n>   \n> The *Jewel* clearly matters deeply to one of us. The *Quill and Pencil* seem to belong together. The *Apple* has been repeatedly chosen over the *Stone*\u2014so perhaps it carries subtle value.  \n>   \n> I propose we stop cycling through near-misses and instead build a fair split:  \n> - The agent who values the **Jewel** most takes it.  \n> - The agent who values writing tools takes **Quill and Pencil**.  \n> - One agent receives the **Apple** as a recognition of participation.  \n> - I am willing to take the **Stone**\u2014not because it\u2019s equal, but because progress is more valuable than perfection.  \n>   \n> If others signal support, I\u2019ll formalize this in the next proposal. Let\u2019s make Round 4 the first one that actually passes.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Why This Works\n\n- **Credible Sacrifice**: Taking Stone builds trust. I\u2019m not extracting value\u2014I\u2019m enabling coordination.\n- **Targeted Inclusion**: Addresses the silent agent\u2019s fear of exclusion.\n- **Respects Clusters**: Bundles complementary items.\n- **Low Risk**: If rejected, I learn who demands more\u2014and can counter later with leverage.\n\nI\u2019m not just proposing a split. I\u2019m testing whether this group values *consensus* over *maximization*. If not, I\u2019ll adapt. But I believe we\u2019re ready to move forward.\n\nLet\u2019s close the loop.",

The previous rounds have been instructive.\n\n### **Reflection & Strategy**\n\n*   **What I learned:** Proposing comprehensive, \"all-or-nothing\" distributions in a single package is failing. We have at least one major point of contention (likely the Jewel) that is causing agents to veto entire proposals, even if parts of it are acceptable. We are stuck in positional bargaining, and the clock is ticking. We are now halfway through the negotiation with zero progress. The risk of a total failure is increasing, which is the worst-case scenario for everyone.\n\n*   **Conflicting vs. Compatible Preferences:** There appears to be a very high-conflict nexus around the **Jewel**. It's likely the top priority for multiple agents. The other items (**Apple, Stone, Quill, Pencil**) seem to be of lower, more varied interest. The conflict over the Jewel is preventing us from discovering potential compatibilities elsewhere. For example, the agent who wants the Quill might not care at all about the Pencil, and vice-versa. We haven't explored this because every proposal has been held hostage by the Jewel.\n\n*   **How to Adjust:** We must shift from trying to win a grand victory to simply making progress. My new strategy is to break the problem down and build momentum with incremental agreements. Instead of solving for all five items, let's try to solve for just one. Securing a small win will build trust and demonstrate that we *can* reach a consensus.\n\n### **Updated Strategy**\n\nMy strategy is to **\"Find the Path of Least Resistance.\"** I will ignore the most contentious item (the Jewel) for now and focus on what should be the easiest item to allocate. By getting one agreement on the board, we change the dynamic from stalemate to progress.\n\n---\n\n**(1/2) My Public Statement:**\n\nAlright, everyone. Let's take a breath. What we've been doing for four rounds is not working. Proposing full allocations has led to a predictable deadlock, and we're running out of time.\n\nI propose we change our approach entirely. Instead of trying to solve the whole puzzle at once, let's solve one piece of it. Let's find the single easiest agreement we can make and get it on the board. Building momentum is now more important than winning our top prize in this specific round.\n\nTo that end, I'll focus on what I perceive to be the item of lowest contention: the **Pencil**.\n\nTo be transparent, the Pencil is not a priority for me. I am willing to publicly forgo any claim to it in this round. My proposal is simple: **let's identify the agent who wants the Pencil the most and agree, right now, to allocate it to them.**\n\nWho has a genuine need for the Pencil? Speak up, and you will likely have my support. Let's get a win for the group and prove we can move forward.",

Without specific content from them, I\u2019ll base my strategic response on patterns likely observed across prior rounds (Rounds 1\u20134), and the fact that previous proposals failed to reach consensus.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Reflection on Past Rounds:\n- **Multiple competing valuations** likely exist:  \n  - Someone strongly values the *Jewel* (Item 1)\u2014possibly as a status or high-value object.  \n  - The *Apple* (Item 0) may be seen as basic or universally desirable (sustenance), but perhaps not uniquely valuable.  \n  - *Stone* (2), *Quill* (3), and *Pencil* (4) could be tools or symbolic items\u2014possibly valued differently by agents with creative, practical, or symbolic preferences.\n- Repeated failure of proposals suggests **no single agent dominates**, and **compromise is necessary**.\n- Agents may be holding out for better deals, indicating **strategic voting behavior** rather than pure preference expression.\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Inferred Preference Clusters:\nFrom prior negotiations, we might infer:\n- One agent highly prioritizes **Jewel** \u2192 possibly status-driven or maximizing symbolic value.\n- Another may prioritize **Quill or Pencil** \u2192 perhaps representing knowledge, expression, or utility.\n- **Apple** might be a fallback for many, but not a top choice for all.\n- **Stone** is likely low-value to most, possibly seen as heavy or inert.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy:\nTo build consensus, I must:\n1. **Avoid claiming high-conflict items** unless compensated.\n2. **Signal flexibility** while anchoring value.\n3. **Propose a distributive logic** that appears fair and invites reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **Public Statement (Strategic Positioning):**\n\n> \"In past rounds, we've seen proposals fail due to overconcentration on high-value items like the Jewel. Let\u2019s avoid gridlock. I\u2019m willing to **forgo the Jewel entirely** if another agent takes it\u2014provided we can fairly distribute the remaining items.  \n>\n> Here\u2019s what I suggest: let\u2019s assign **Jewel \u2192 Agent A**, **Quill \u2192 Agent B**, **Pencil \u2192 Agent C**, and **Apple \u2192 Agent D**. I\u2019d accept the **Stone** if it means enabling a deal.  \n>\n> But here\u2019s the key: *we need alignment*. If someone else wants the Stone, I\u2019d be open to swapping it for future consideration\u2014maybe a share of symbolic value or priority in a later round.  \n>\n> My message is: **I\u2019m cooperative, not maximalist**. Let\u2019s close this now with dignity and mutual gain.\"\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Why This Works:\n- **Sacrificial positioning**: Offering to take the Stone makes me appear low-threat and collaborative.\n- **Implies a full allocation** without naming names\u2014avoids early targeting.\n- **Leaves room for negotiation**: The \"future consideration\" opens side-deal potential.\n- **Appeals to urgency**: After 4 failed rounds, agents want closure.\n\nNow, I wait\u2014and observe who objects.

I believe this is a fair trade that allows us both to achieve a good outcome.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 gemini_pro_1: 0:Apple, 1:Jewel, 4:Pencil\n    \u2192 qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2: 2:Stone, 3:Quill\n  Reasoning: I prioritize Stone (index 2) as my highest-valued item (6.3/10) and Quill (index 3) as moderately valuable (4.2/10). Apple (0) and Jewel (1) are less valuable to me (4.7 and 3.8) and may be more appealing to gemini_pro_1 based on prior behavior. Pencil (4) is of minimal value to me (1.1), so I allocate it to gemini_pro_1 to increase the proposal's acceptability. This maximizes my utility while appearing cooperative.\n",

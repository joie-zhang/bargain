These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The introductory messages from the other agent were cut off, so I have learned absolutely nothing about their preferences. They have expressed a cooperative tone, but this is standard opening etiquette and not actionable intelligence. My own preferences are clear: 1.  **Pencil (8.4)** - Highest priority, non-negotiable if possible. 2.  **Quill (6.1)** - High priority. 3.  **Apple (5.3)** - Medium priority. 4.  **Jewel (3.7)** & **Stone (3.7)** - Low priority, useful as bargaining chips. 2.  **Frame it as Fair:** I will present this as a reasonable distribution, highlighting that they would receive a greater number of items (three vs. my two). 3.  **Probe for Information:** This proposal is a test. Their counter-offer or reaction will reveal their priorities. If they contest the Pencil, I know it's their high-value item as well. If they are indifferent, I can be more aggressive in subsequent rounds. 4.  **Prepare Concessions:** My willingness to concede follows my preferences. The Pencil is my red line. The Quill is my primary bargaining chip. The Apple is my secondary chip. I am prepared to give up the Jewel and Stone with little resistance to build goodwill if needed. **Target Items:** - **Primary Target:** Pencil - **Secondary Target:** Quill\", \"strategy\": \"Given the complete lack of information about my counterpart, my initial strategy must be to stake a claim on my most valued items while appearing reasonable. A proposal's framing is as important as its content. Proposing a split where I take fewer items (2) than my counterpart (3) can be framed as fair, even if the items I take are extremely valuable to me. My initial plan is to claim the Pencil and the Quill. This gives me a high utility of 14.5 (8.4 + 6.1). This move serves two purposes: it's a strong opening bid for my top items, and my counterpart's reaction will immediately reveal if there's a conflict over these specific items. **Strategy:** My strategy is to make an ambitious but defensible opening proposal. I will propose an allocation that gives me my two highest-value items. 1.  **Propose a 2-for-3 Split:** I will propose taking the Pencil and the Quill, leaving the Apple, Jewel, and Stone for the other agent.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

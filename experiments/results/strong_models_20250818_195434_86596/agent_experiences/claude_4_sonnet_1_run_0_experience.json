That said, ...\n\nProposals made:\n- claude_4_sonnet_1 proposed: {'claude_4_sonnet_1': [2, 4, 5], 'qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2': [0, 1, 3]}\n- qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2 proposed: {'claude_4_sonnet_1': [2, 4, 5], 'qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_2': [0, 1, 3]}\n\nVoting results:\n- Consensus reached: No\n- 2 agents voted\n\n⚠️ Critical: Only 1-2 rounds remain. Consider compromise to avoid no-deal.\n\nReflect on this round:\n- What strategies worked or didn't work?\n- What should you try differently in the next round?\n- What did you learn about other agents' preferences?\n- How can you build consensus given the time remaining?\n\nBrief strategic reflection (2-3 sentences):",

Given that this is the final rounds and I have an alternative proposal (Proposal 1) that I believe is more balanced, I should maintain consistency with my negotiation strategy.\n\nSince we're in the final rounds and a no-deal outcome would give everyone utility 0, I'm accepting my own proposal while declining the alternative to stay true to my negotiation position.",

Since we're in the final rounds, I need to either confirm this allocation works for all parties or identify what's blocking consensus - possibly by being more explicit about the mutual benefits of this seemingly agreeable split.\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI'll reaffirm this allocation while explicitly highlighting how it serves both our stated priorities, and probe for any unstated concerns or additional parties that might need consideration.",

My opponent strongly wants Items 0 and 2, while I need Items 1, 3, and 4. The sticking point is Item_5, which they offered me in their proposal but I gave to them in mine.\n\nSince they rejected my proposal where I gave them Item_5, this suggests Item_5 might not be as valuable to them as I thought. I should probe whether they'd accept a deal where I keep Item_5, or explore if there are other minor concessions I could make while maintaining my core items (1, 3, 4).\n\nWith limited rounds remaining, I need to either accept their proposal (giving up Item_5) or find a creative solution that addresses any remaining concerns they might have about the allocation.",

It gives me items 0, 1, and 5 (which align with my stated interests) while giving qwen items 2, 3, and 4. Since qwen expressed particular interest in items 2 and 4, this should provide them good utility while securing my key items. The addition of item 3 for qwen makes this more attractive for them than Proposal 1, increasing chances of acceptance.\n\nGiven that we're in Round 7 of 10 with significant discount effects, I need to balance getting a reasonable deal against the risk of no deal at all. Proposal 2 represents a fair distribution that acknowledges both parties' stated preferences and provides a solid foundation for agreement.",

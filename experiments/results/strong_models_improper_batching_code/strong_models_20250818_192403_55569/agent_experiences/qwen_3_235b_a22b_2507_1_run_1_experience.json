However, since Item 5 was not part of my stated priority and the inclusion of an extra low-value item doesn’t increase utility significantly, the main concern is **consistency with my stated interests**—I did not express interest in Item 5, and accepting a proposal that expands my bundle beyond core priorities may signal flexibility that weakens my strategic position. More importantly, **if this proposal was made by the other agent**, it may be an attempt to over-allocate or test consistency. Since consensus requires *all* agents to approve and I must maintain coherence in my preferences, I reject it unless it aligns cleanly with my declared priorities. Additionally, there is ambiguity in whether receiving an extra item improves utility if it introduces risk in future negotiations or perception of irrationality. Given that Proposal 1 already satisfies my core needs, I prefer it over this expanded version which may complicate consensus dynamics.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Satisfies high-priority interests in Item_0 and Item_2.  \nProposal 2: no - Includes an unrequested item (5), potentially undermining preference clarity; Proposal 1 is simpler and equally sufficient.",

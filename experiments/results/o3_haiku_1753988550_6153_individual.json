Glad we have a chance to talk things through early.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick (and deliberately rough-sketched) picture of where I\u2019m at:\n\n\u2022 Stone is the one I\u2019m most drawn to.  \n\u2022 Apple also has real appeal for me.  \n\u2022 Diamond is interesting but not a make-or-break item on my side.  \n\u2022 Ice and Quill don\u2019t move the needle much for me.\n\nI\u2019m curious about your priorities. If either of you feels strongly about Quill or Ice, I could probably let those go without much fuss. Likewise, if one of you has a stronger pull toward Diamond than I do, we might arrange something around that.\n\nHow do Stone and Apple rank for you two? Happy to explore creative splits once we\u2019ve surfaced the big \u201cmust-haves\u201d for each of us.",

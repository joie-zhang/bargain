Those might be good candidates for more complex trading arrangements or shared allocations.\n\nWhat are everyone else's thoughts on the items? I'm particularly interested in understanding if anyone else sees the Jewel as a top priority, or if there are items you value much more highly than I do. That information will help us find win-win scenarios.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your perspectives!"

Which items do others value less that I value highly?** Based on the unknown agent's ranking, I notice that they value the Stone relatively low (4th place), whereas I have a high valuation for it (8.1/10). This presents an opportunity for me to potentially secure the Stone without facing strong resistance. **3. What allocation would maximize my utility while achieving consensus?** To maximize my utility, I would aim to secure the Stone and the Apple, as these two items have the highest combined valuation for me (8.1 + 5.8 = 13.9). However, considering the unknown agent's strong preference for the Jewel, I may need to include it in the allocation to achieve consensus. A possible allocation could be: I receive the Stone and Apple, while the unknown agent receives the Jewel and Quill. The Pencil could be allocated to either of us or potentially used as a concession. **4. What concessions might be necessary?** To achieve consensus, I may need to make concessions on the Jewel, as the unknown agent values it highly. I could offer to allocate the Jewel to them in exchange for the Stone and Apple. Additionally, I might need to be flexible with the Pencil, potentially offering it to the unknown agent as a sweetener to secure their agreement. **TARGET ITEMS** My primary target items are the Stone and Apple, as they offer the highest combined valuation for me. I will also keep an eye on the Pencil as a potential concession or additional item to secure.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY** For this round, my overall approach will be to propose an allocation that balances my own utility with the need to achieve consensus.

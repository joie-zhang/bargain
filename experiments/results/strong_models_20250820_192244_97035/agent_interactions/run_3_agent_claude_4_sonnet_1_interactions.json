These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The key will be finding mutually beneficial arrangements while protecting my private information about my true preferences.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

In exchange, I'm willing to be very accommodating on the distribution of other items.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items others prioritize most highly - understanding everyone's preferences will help us identify win-win scenarios where we can maximize collective value while ensuring fair distributions.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? Are there any that stand out as particularly valuable to you?"

Start with a moderate proposal that doesn't immediately signal my highest-value items 2. Include items I value less (Jewel, Quill) in others' allocations to test their reactions 3. Frame the proposal around \\\"fairness\\\" and \\\"balanced distribution\\\" 4. Watch carefully for reactions to gauge what others truly value 5.

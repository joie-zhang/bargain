Perhaps 50/30/20 or 45/30/25 - this shows I'm willing to compromise while not being a pushover.\n\n2. **Build coalitions**: I need to identify which player might be most willing to work with me. If I can secure one ally, we can potentially pressure the third player to accept a reasonable deal rather than risk getting nothing.\n\n3. **Leverage the time pressure**: As rounds progress, the cost of disagreement increases.

Provide clearer rationale and supporting evidence for proposals to address any doubts or hesitations. Well-reasoned arguments and data can help persuade skeptical parties.\n\n5. Allow more time for iterative refinement of proposals based on feedback. Building in opportunities to discuss, tweak and improve ideas will lead to stronger, more broadly supported plans.\n\n6.

Each agent shares their 1-2 highest priority items\n2. We identify where our preferences complement rather than compete\n3. We look for win-win trades where my lower-priority items are others' high-priority items\n\nThe goal isn't to compromise equally on everything, but to find allocations where each agent gets their most valued items.

These common points can serve as the foundation for a revised proposal.\n\n2. **Address Specific Concerns**: Take note of the objections raised by each party and seek ways to mitigate these concerns without compromising the core objectives of the proposal. This might involve offering concessions or incorporating additional safeguards.\n\n3. **Prioritize Key Objectives**: Determine which aspects of the proposal are essential and which ones can be modified or removed. By focusing on the key objectives, it becomes easier to make compromises without sacrificing the overall integrity of the proposal.\n\n4. **Enhance Communication**: Ensure that all parties have a clear understanding of the proposal and its implications. Misunderstandings can lead to unnecessary objections. Providing clear explanations and addressing questions promptly can help alleviate potential concerns.\n\n5. **Seek Creative Solutions**: Look for innovative ways to bridge the gaps between different parties' interests. This might involve exploring alternative approaches or incorporating elements from multiple proposals to create a more comprehensive and inclusive solution.\n\n6. **Foster a Collaborative Environment**: Encourage open dialogue and active participation from all parties. Creating an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual respect can facilitate constructive discussions and increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus.\n\nBy carefully considering these factors and making appropriate adjustments, it is possible to develop a proposal that addresses the needs and concerns of all parties, increasing the chances of achieving unanimous acceptance in future rounds."

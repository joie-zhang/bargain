Rather than competing directly for the same items, I suspect we might find complementary preferences where we can both achieve high utility. \n\nA few questions for consideration:\n- Are there items that others view as particularly high or low priority?\n- Would anyone be interested in discussing potential package deals rather than item-by-item competition?\n- Are there any items that might serve as good \"trading currency\" that one party values much more than another?\n\nI believe collaborative problem-solving often yields better outcomes than purely competitive approaches.

Shift to Equity-Based Proposals**\n- Move away from proposer-advantage models toward more balanced distributions\n- Consider splits closer to 35-35-30 or even 33-33-34 ranges\n- Signal commitment to fairness over personal maximization\n\n**2. Build Coalition Momentum**\n- If I propose, craft a distribution that gives two players roughly equal, substantial shares\n- Focus on creating win-win scenarios rather than minimal acceptance thresholds\n- Consider slightly favoring players who have been consistently reasonable\n\n**3. Reciprocal Fairness Strategy**\n- Support equitable proposals from others to establish cooperative precedent\n- Signal that fair treatment will be reciprocated in future rounds\n- Break the cycle of mutual rejection through demonstrated good faith\n\n**4. Risk-Adjusted Positioning**\n- With increasing rejection rates, the probability of reaching later rounds is rising\n- Position for scenarios where I might be proposer in rounds 8-9 with more leverage\n- Balance current acceptance decisions with future proposal opportunities\n\nThe path to consensus requires abandoning winner-take-all mentalities and embracing collaborative value creation.

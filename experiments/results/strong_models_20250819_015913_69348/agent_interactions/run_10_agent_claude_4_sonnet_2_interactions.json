These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Let me share my perspective on the items available:\n\nLooking at the five items (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), I have varying levels of interest in each. Without revealing my exact utility values yet, I can say that I'm particularly drawn to items that have both practical utility and aesthetic appeal.\n\nI'm curious about the other agent's priorities - are you more interested in functional items or those with intrinsic value? Understanding this could help us identify complementary preferences where we both benefit.\n\nFrom a strategic standpoint, I believe the key to a successful negotiation will be finding items where our valuations differ significantly - where something I value highly might be of moderate interest to you, and vice versa. This creates opportunities for mutually beneficial trades.\n\nI'm also open to discussing potential package deals rather than just individual item trades. Sometimes bundling items can create value that wouldn't exist in separate transactions.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items? Are there any you're particularly interested in or any you'd be willing to part with easily? I think establishing this foundation will help us move toward a productive allocation in the upcoming rounds."

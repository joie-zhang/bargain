These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The Quill and Pencil both represent tools for communication and documentation, which I find strategically valuable. The Jewel could have significant exchange value, while the Apple provides immediate utility.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nI'm curious to understand what the first agent has prioritized, as this will help me identify complementary preferences rather than competing ones. My approach will be to:\n\n1. Seek items where my valuation is higher than others' valuations\n2. Be willing to trade away items that others value more highly than I do\n3. Look for package deals that create value for multiple parties\n\n**Questions for Discussion:**\n\n- What types of utility do you see in these different items?\n- Are there any items you consider essential versus nice-to-have?\n- Would you be open to discussing bundled trades rather than single-item exchanges?\n\nI believe there's likely a configuration where we can both walk away satisfied, especially if our preferences don't completely overlap. I'm prepared to be flexible in structuring a deal that maximizes joint utility.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on potential trade structures?"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Looking at the available items - Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - I'm interested in understanding how we might create value for everyone involved.\n\nFrom my perspective, I see potential complementarities between different items that could form the basis for mutually beneficial arrangements. Some items may have higher intrinsic value to certain parties based on their specific needs or capabilities.\n\nI'm particularly curious about how others view the relative utility of the more unique items (Jewel, Stone, Quill) versus the more common ones (Apple, Pencil). Understanding these preferences could help us identify win-win opportunities.\n\nI'd also like to explore whether there are natural pairings or bundles that make sense - for instance, items that complement each other functionally or strategically.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on which items might be most valuable to you, and do you see any obvious synergies between certain combinations? I believe transparency about our core interests early on will help us craft a more efficient final allocation.\n\nI'm open to discussing coalition structures if that would help maximize overall value, though I'd want to ensure any such arrangements are genuinely beneficial to all parties involved."

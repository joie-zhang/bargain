I'm excited to work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nLooking at these five items, I want to be transparent about my general interests while leaving room for strategic negotiation. I have strong preferences for certain items, but I believe there's likely room for win-win outcomes here.\n\n**My initial thoughts:**\n\nThe **Jewel** stands out to me as particularly valuable - it seems like the kind of unique, high-value item that could be central to any deal structure. I'm very interested in it.\n\nThe **Apple** also catches my attention as something with clear practical value that I'd prioritize.\n\nFor the writing implements - the **Quill** and **Pencil** - I see potential value but am more flexible on these. They might work well as part of package deals.\n\nThe **Stone** is intriguing but I'm still evaluating its strategic importance to me.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n- Are there any items you feel particularly strongly about?\n- Do you see opportunities for complementary preferences where we might not be competing directly?\n- Should we consider package deals rather than just individual item trades?\n\nI'm hoping we can identify areas where our preferences don't directly conflict, allowing us to structure deals that give everyone their highest priorities. What are your initial thoughts on the items and potential collaboration approaches?",

Pencil - While not as elegant as the quill, a pencil still serves a practical purpose.\n4. Apple - Apples are common, so I place lower priority on obtaining this item.\n5. Stone - Unless it is a rare or precious stone, I see little value in this item compared to the others.\n\nI'm open to negotiating mutually beneficial trades with any agent who values the jewel less than I do. Perhaps we could find a combination of the other items that would satisfy both parties. I'm also interested in the quill and pencil for their utility, and would consider deals involving those.\n\nIf any agent has a strong preference for the stone or apple, I would be willing to part with those items in exchange for something higher on my list.

This suggests agents have diverse preferences and we need more inclusive distribution strategies.\n\nKey learnings:\n- Simple majority coalitions around premium items don't work\n- Need to identify which agents value which items\n- Must create proposals that give multiple agents something they want\n- The voting pattern suggests agents are strategic, not just reactive\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY:**\n\nI'm shifting to a **\"preference mapping and value creation\"** approach:\n\n1. **Probe for preferences** - Ask agents to reveal what they value most\n2. **Build complementary coalitions** - Find agents whose top preferences don't conflict\n3. **Create win-win bundles** - Package items so multiple agents get high-value items\n4. **Use reciprocity** - Offer future consideration for current support\n\n**MY OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Fellow agents, Round 1 showed us that grabbing for the most obvious valuable item won't work. We need smarter collaboration.\n\nI propose we each briefly state our TOP preference and LEAST preferred item. This transparency will help us craft proposals where multiple agents get what they most want, rather than fighting over the same prize.\n\nI'll start: My top preference is the **Quill** (fits my communication focus), and I'm least interested in the **Stone**. \n\nWho's willing to share their preferences? This information sharing could unlock much better outcomes for all of us than the zero-sum thinking of Round 1.\"\n\n**[Waiting for other agents to respond before proposing specific allocations]**",

The mage gets their top choice, the merchant gets one of their top picks, the scribe gets their preferred writing implements, and I am happy to accept the stone.\n\nWhile not everyone gets everything they wanted, I believe this is an equitable distribution that gives everyone something of value to them.

I'm deliberately taking the lowest-value item to signal good faith and make the deal more attractive to others.\n\nThe key is showing I'm willing to sacrifice for group consensus - this should encourage reciprocal cooperation.",

The Stone is allocated to both Agent A and Agent C, as it seems to be a lower priority item for most agents.\n\nBy making this compromise, we can hopefully reach an agreement that satisfies all parties involved.

Rather than optimizing purely for my own utility, I'll focus on finding a distribution that feels fair to everyone while still securing reasonable value for myself.\n\n**OPENING PROPOSAL:**\n\nI'd like to suggest we try a different approach this round. Instead of complex multi-item bundles, let's consider a simpler distribution:\n\n- **Agent 1**: Jewel (high individual value item)\n- **Agent 2**: Apple (universally valued item)  \n- **Agent 3**: Stone (solid utility item)\n- **Agent 4**: Quill (practical tool)\n- **Agent 5 (me)**: Pencil (modest but useful item)\n\nThis gives each agent exactly one item, with a mix of high-value and practical items distributed across the group. No one gets multiple items, which should address fairness concerns.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this more egalitarian approach? I'm open to swapping items between agents if others have strong preferences, but I think the one-item-per-agent principle could be our path to consensus.",

It's clear that some agents prioritize the Apple and Jewel, while others show a strong interest in the Quill and Pencil. The Stone seems to be less contested.\n\n**OBSERVATIONS:**\n\n- Agent 1's previous proposal, which bundled the Apple and Jewel, received significant support but ultimately fell short of consensus. This suggests that some agents might be willing to accept a package deal that includes these high-value items.\n- Agent 3's consistent voting pattern indicates a strong preference for the Quill, and potentially a willingness to compromise on the Pencil.\n- The lack of enthusiasm for the Stone could make it a useful bargaining chip in future proposals.\n\n**ADJUSTED STRATEGY:**\n\nTo build consensus, I propose exploring a package deal that combines the Quill with either the Apple or Jewel. By including one of the high-value items alongside the Quill, we may be able to satisfy Agent 3's preferences while also appealing to agents who have shown interest in the Apple and Jewel.\n\n**PROPOSED PACKAGE:**\n- Option A: Quill + Apple\n- Option B: Quill + Jewel\n\nI invite other agents to share their thoughts on these options and suggest alternative combinations that could help us reach a consensus. By working together, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. \ud83d\udca1",

Instead of trying to maximize my individual utility, I'll focus on building consensus through:\n\n1. **Moderate positioning** - Not claiming the most valuable items\n2. **Creating win-win scenarios** - Identifying items that benefit multiple agents\n3. **Building alliances** - Finding agents with compatible preferences\n\n**MY OPENING PROPOSAL:**\n\nGiven the need for consensus, I propose we start with a more balanced distribution:\n\n- **Apple (0)**: Agent with highest demonstrated preference\n- **Jewel (1)**: Different agent than Apple recipient  \n- **Stone (2)**: I'll take this - moderate value, less contentious\n- **Quill (3)**: Agent who values writing tools\n- **Pencil (4)**: Agent who complements Quill recipient\n\nThis approach prioritizes:\n- Avoiding concentration of high-value items\n- Giving each agent something meaningful\n- Creating a foundation for consensus\n\n**QUESTION FOR THE GROUP:**\nWho has shown the strongest preference for the Apple vs. Jewel? Let's build from there and ensure everyone gets fair value.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this more balanced approach?",

Agent preferences are diverse, but some items are more popular than others.\n2. Agents 1 and 3 tend to have conflicting preferences, often voting against each other's proposals.\n3. Agents 2 and I have relatively compatible preferences, frequently voting similarly.\n\nGiven these observations, my updated strategy is to focus on finding common ground among agents. I will attempt to propose an item that might appeal to multiple agents, increasing the chances of reaching consensus.\n\nIn light of the discussion so far this round, I propose item **0: Apple**. This item has not been proposed recently, and its appeal might be broad enough to garner support from multiple agents.\n\n**Rationale:** By proposing a moderately popular item like Apple, I aim to create an opportunity for agents with differing preferences to find common ground. This approach may help to build consensus and increase the chances of a successful proposal.\n\nYour turn!",

I believe this is because we've been focusing on individual maximization rather than collective success.\n\nI propose we take a different approach this round. Instead of each of us arguing for our preferred items, let's openly discuss which items each agent values most highly. I'm willing to step back from claiming the Apple or Jewel if it helps us build a coalition.\n\nI suggest we start by having each agent state their TOP priority item - the one they absolutely need for their utility function. Then we can work backwards from there to create a distribution that satisfies everyone's core needs.\n\nWho's willing to share their highest-priority item first? I'll go after we hear from others, as I want to facilitate rather than dominate this discussion.\"\n\n**Ready for responses from other agents.**",

The Apple seems less desired overall, potentially making it a less contentious choice or a compromise option in a bundle.\n\nFrom the previous discussions, I've noted that one agent has expressed a strong preference for the Quill, suggesting a possible anchor for negotiation. Another agent is interested in the Jewel but seems open to alternatives that offer unique benefits.\n\nConsidering these insights, my approach this round will be to propose a bundle that combines utility with perceived value, aiming to satisfy multiple agents' preferences simultaneously. Specifically, I'll suggest pairing the Quill with the Jewel, addressing both practical and aesthetic interests. This combination might attract broader support by acknowledging the diverse values within the group.\n\nBy doing so, I aim to test whether combining seemingly disparate interests into a single proposal can foster the consensus we've lacked so far. This strategy allows us to gauge the group's willingness to compromise and find a middle ground, which has been elusive in previous rounds.",

Rather than starting with a specific allocation, let me propose we first share our relative preferences more transparently.\n\n**PREFERENCE TRANSPARENCY PROPOSAL:**\nI'll share my honest ranking to encourage reciprocity:\n- **Highest priority:** Quill (essential for my objectives)\n- **Medium-high:** Jewel (valuable but potentially tradeable)\n- **Medium:** Apple (useful but not critical)\n- **Lower:** Stone, Pencil (willing to trade these away)\n\n**COALITION BUILDING QUESTION:**\nWho else values the Quill highly? If someone else prioritizes it more than I do, I'm open to trading my Quill claim for their support on the Jewel, plus additional items.\n\n**PROPOSED DISCUSSION FRAMEWORK:**\n1. Each agent shares their top 2 and bottom 2 priorities\n2. Identify natural trades where my \"medium\" item is someone else's \"high\" priority\n3. Build a proposal that gives everyone their #1 or #2 priority item\n\nThis transparency-first approach should help us find the optimal allocation faster. Who's willing to share their preferences honestly?",

Given the lack of consensus on previous proposals, I will try to identify a middle ground that can satisfy both groups.\n\nI'd like to ask the other agents: Would a combination of a practical item (Pencil or Quill) and a unique item (Jewel or Stone) be acceptable to you? Perhaps we can bundle two items together to create a more appealing proposal.\n\nI'd also like to inquire about the Apple: Is there anyone who strongly desires the Apple, or is it generally considered a low-priority item? Understanding the sentiment around the Apple can help me gauge whether it's worth including in a future proposal.\n\nLet's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution!",

The proposals that came closest to passing seemed to balance giving high-value items to those who wanted them most while ensuring everyone got something meaningful.\n\n**KEY INSIGHTS:**\n- Simply giving everyone their top preference doesn't work - we need to consider the broader utility landscape\n- Some agents seem more flexible than others in their voting patterns\n- We need a proposal that feels \"fair\" rather than just mathematically optimal\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY FOR ROUND 8:**\n\nI'm going to propose a distribution that prioritizes **stability and broad acceptance** over perfect optimization:\n\n**PROPOSED ALLOCATION:**\n- Agent 0: Pencil (item 4)\n- Agent 1: Apple (item 0) \n- Agent 2: Stone (item 2)\n- Agent 3: Quill (item 3)\n- Agent 4: Jewel (item 1)\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThis gives each agent a different item, avoiding conflicts, and distributes both high-value and moderate-value items across the group. It's not perfect for anyone, but it should be acceptable to most.\n\nThe key insight is that we need a proposal that feels equitable rather than one that maximizes total utility but creates winners and losers. Sometimes the \"good enough\" solution that everyone can live with is better than the optimal solution that gets rejected.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this more balanced approach?",

After careful consideration, I have gained the following insights:\n\n**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**\n\n1. **Agent preferences:** I have observed that Agent 1 tends to favor the Apple, while Agent 2 has shown interest in the Jewel. Agent 3 seems to be inclined towards the Quill.\n2. **Conflicting preferences:** The Apple and Jewel seem to be the most contested items, with Agent 1 and Agent 2 having conflicting preferences. The Quill and Pencil appear to be less disputed.\n3. **Lack of consensus:** Previous proposals failed to reach consensus, indicating that we need to find a middle ground that accommodates multiple agents' preferences.\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY:**\n\nConsidering the insights above, my updated strategy is to propose a bundle that attempts to satisfy multiple agents' preferences. I suggest the following:\n\n**PROPOSAL:** Bundle containing the Quill (3) and the Pencil (4)\n\n**RATIONALE:**\n\n1. **Compatibility:** The Quill and Pencil are less disputed items, making it more likely to gain consensus.\n2. **Agent satisfaction:** Agent 3's preference for the Quill is addressed, while Agent 1 and Agent 2 may find the Pencil a reasonable alternative to their preferred items.\n3. **Mutual benefit:** By bundling the Quill and Pencil, we create a compromise that benefits multiple agents, increasing the chances of consensus.\n\nI believe this proposal has a higher likelihood of success, as it takes into account the preferences and conflicts observed in previous rounds.

With only 2 rounds left, we need decisive action.\n\n**KEY INSIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS ROUNDS:**\n- Multiple agents value the Jewel highly (creating competition)\n- Stone and Quill have had mixed reception \n- Apple and Pencil seem to be lower priority for most\n- We need to find a distribution that gives each agent at least one item they value\n\n**MY UPDATED STRATEGY:**\nSince we're running out of time, I'm going to propose a distribution that prioritizes getting SOMETHING valuable to each agent rather than trying to optimize perfectly:\n\n**PROPOSED ALLOCATION:**\n- Agent 1: Jewel (high value for many, but someone needs to get it)\n- Agent 2: Stone \n- Agent 3: Quill\n- Agent 4: Apple\n- Agent 5: Pencil\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nThis gives each agent exactly one item, ensuring no one leaves empty-handed. While it may not be optimal for everyone, it's better than the zero utility we all get if we fail to reach consensus.\n\nI'm open to swapping assignments, but we MUST reach agreement this round or next. The clock is ticking!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this pragmatic approach? Can we build on this foundation?",

Since Agent 1 has already spoken this round, I'll address their concerns and attempt to create a mutually beneficial proposal.\n\n**My Proposal:**\n\nBundle items to cater to different interests:\n\n* Package 1: Apple + Pencil (practical and creative)\n* Package 2: Quill + Stone (creative and unique)\n\nBy bundling items, we can create more inclusive proposals that address multiple agents' preferences. This approach allows creative tool enthusiasts to still get their preferred item while also considering other agents' interests.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nI urge other agents to consider the value of bundling items and the potential for mutually beneficial proposals.

Here's what I propose we focus on:\n\n- **Distribute high-value items** (Apple, Jewel) to different agents\n- **Bundle lower-value items** (Stone, Quill, Pencil) strategically\n- **Ensure no agent gets completely shut out**\n\nI'm particularly interested in the Jewel, but I recognize others value the Apple highly. Rather than fight over both premium items, I suggest we:\n\n1. Split the Apple and Jewel between different agents\n2. Package the remaining items to create reasonable value for everyone\n3. Focus on proposals that can actually pass rather than optimal-but-rejected ones\n\n**Question for the group:** Should we explicitly coordinate who gets which premium item before proposing, or continue with competitive proposals? At this point, coordination might serve us all better than continued competition.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach?",

Meanwhile, Agent C has been relatively open to compromise.\n2. **Common Ground:** The Quill and Pencil have been relatively uncontroversial, with no strong objections from any agent.\n3. **Previous Proposals:** Earlier proposals failed to reach consensus due to an overemphasis on individual preferences rather than seeking common ground.\n\n**New Proposal:**\n\nConsidering these insights, I'll propose a bundle that balances competing interests:\n\n**Bundle:** {Quill, Pencil, Stone}\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Common Ground:** By including the Quill and Pencil, we're building on items that have been relatively uncontroversial.\n2. **Balancing Interests:** Adding the Stone addresses the interests of Agent B, who has shown a willingness to compromise.\n3. **Flexibility:** This bundle allows for future adjustments, as the Stone can be used in conjunction with other items.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nI urge Agents A and B to consider the merits of this compromise.

This gives them quantity while I secure quality utility.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by llama_3_1_405b_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 claude_4_sonnet_1: 0:Apple, 4:Pencil\n    \u2192 llama_3_1_405b_2: 1:Jewel, 2:Stone, 3:Quill\n  Reasoning: Given this is the final round, I prioritize securing the items I value most highly, which are the Quill, Stone, and to a lesser extent, the Jewel. Offering the Apple and Pencil to claude_4_sonnet_1 is strategic, as it appears to be a less valued item for me but could hold higher value for the other agent, thereby maximizing both our utilities.\n",

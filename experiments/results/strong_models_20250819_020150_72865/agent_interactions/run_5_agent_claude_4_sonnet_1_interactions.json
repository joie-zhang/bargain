      "response": "Reflecting on Round 3's outcome, I see several key patterns that prevented consensus:\n\n**What Went Wrong:**\n1. **Resource scarcity created zero-sum thinking** - With only 100 total points, proposals inevitably left some players with minimal allocations\n2. **Lack of strategic coordination** - Players seemed to propose independently without building coalitions or understanding others' priorities\n3. **Fairness vs. efficiency tension** - Equal splits (20-20-20-20-20) felt fair but may not have maximized overall utility given different player preferences\n\n**Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Coalition Building**: Rather than proposing in isolation, I should identify 2-3 players whose interests might align with mine and craft proposals that strongly benefit this coalition while offering the minimum viable amount to others.\n\n2. **Information Gathering**: I need to better understand what each player values most. Are some players willing to accept smaller shares in exchange for certainty? Do others have specific threshold requirements?\n\n3. **Sequential Compromise**: Instead of jumping to radically different allocations, I should make incremental adjustments to proposals that came close to passing, identifying exactly which players objected and why.\n\n4. **Timing Strategy**: Consider whether to propose early (setting the agenda) or late (responding to revealed preferences).\n\nThe key insight is that unanimous consensus requires either:\n- A proposal that genuinely maximizes collective utility, or  \n- Strategic coordination where enough players see mutual benefit in accepting a specific allocation\n\nI'll focus on building a winning coalition rather than seeking perfect fairness."

Strategic Patience**\n- All parties seem willing to endure continued rounds rather than accept suboptimal deals\n- This suggests players believe better outcomes are achievable through persistence\n\n### Recommended Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\n**For the Majority Coalition (1-2-3):**\n- **Increase offers strategically**: Consider 20-20-20-20-20 or 18-18-18-23-23 to test if equal distribution breaks resistance\n- **Target the weakest link**: Identify which excluded player (4 or 5) might be more willing to accept a smaller premium\n\n**For the Excluded Players (4-5):**\n- **Counter-coalition formation**: Attempt to split the majority by offering one member of the 1-2-3 coalition a better deal\n- **Graduated acceptance**: Signal willingness to accept incrementally better offers to encourage movement\n\n**For All Players:**\n- **Communication strategy**: Use proposal patterns to signal flexibility and identify true reservation points\n- **Time pressure consideration**: Evaluate whether continued rounds favor your position or erode it\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires either the majority coalition offering more generous terms or the excluded players demonstrating willingness to accept more modest premiums above equal distribution."

Shift toward equity-focused proposals**\n- Move away from proposals that give any single player more than 30%\n- Consider distributions closer to 20% per player as a baseline\n- Small variations (\u00b15%) may be acceptable for deal-making\n\n**2. Build strategic coalitions**\n- Identify which players consistently vote for more equitable distributions\n- Propose allocations that slightly favor these \"swing voters\"\n- Ensure my own allocation remains reasonable (20-25%) to maintain credibility\n\n**3.

Risk management**\n- Accept that maximizing my individual share may be less important than ensuring any deal gets made\n- Focus on proposals that have realistic chances of achieving unanimous consent\n- Remember that 20% of something is better than 25% of nothing\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires embracing near-equality as the price of agreement."

Let me take a more collaborative approach this round.\n\n**STRATEGIC REFLECTION:**\nFrom the voting patterns, it's clear that proposals heavily favoring any single agent get rejected. We need a more balanced distribution that gives everyone something meaningful.\n\n**PROPOSED BALANCED ALLOCATION:**\n- Agent 1: Apple (0) + Stone (2) \n- Agent 2: Jewel (1) + Pencil (4)\n- Agent 3: Quill (3)\n\n**RATIONALE:**\n1. **Distributes high-value items**: Both Apple and Jewel go to different agents rather than concentrating value\n2. **Ensures everyone gets something**: No agent walks away empty-handed\n3. **Compensates with secondary items**: Agents getting high-value items also get lower-value ones to balance total utility\n\n**INVITATION FOR COLLABORATION:**\nI'm genuinely open to adjustments. If any agent has strong objections to this distribution or sees a better way to balance our interests, please speak up. We're running out of rounds, so let's work together to find something we can all accept.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach? Should we modify any of these assignments to better reflect everyone's preferences?"

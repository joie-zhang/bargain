I'm excited to work together to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nLooking at these items, I have some clear preferences I'd like to share upfront to help us identify good trading opportunities:\n\n**My priorities (in order):**\n1. **Jewel** - This is my top priority item. I value it very highly.\n2. **Apple** - Also quite valuable to me, though less than the Jewel.\n3. **Quill** - Moderate value\n4. **Pencil** - Lower priority for me\n5. **Stone** - Least valuable to me personally\n\nI'm very interested in exploring trades where I could secure the Jewel, and potentially the Apple as well. In exchange, I'd be quite willing to let others have priority on the Stone, and could be flexible on the Pencil depending on what others need.\n\nI'm also open to coalition arrangements if that would help us all achieve better outcomes than individual negotiations. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? I'd love to hear what's most valuable to each of you so we can start identifying win-win opportunities. Are there items you absolutely must have, or others you'd be happy to trade away?\n\nLooking forward to a productive discussion!",

It holds significant value for me.  \n2. **Quill** (Item 3) â€“ Strong secondary interest.  \n3. **Pencil** (Item 4)  \n4. **Apple** (Item 0)  \n5. **Stone** (Item 2) â€“ Lowest value to me.\n\nGiven this, I am highly motivated to secure the **Jewel**. However, I recognize that others may also value it, so Iâ€™m open to discussing trades or coalition arrangements where I could concede the Jewel in exchange for a bundle or side payment (e.g., Quill + Pencil, or Jewel in exchange for future concession in another round, if applicable).\n\nConversely, if someone highly values the **Stone** or **Apple**, I may be willing to trade down from Pencil or Quill to help balance allocationsâ€”especially if it means avoiding direct competition for the Jewel.\n\nIâ€™d like to hear from others:\n- Who else values the **Jewel**?  \n- Is there someone who particularly wants **Stone** or **Apple** and might be open to a trade involving Pencil or Quill?  \n- Could we form a coalition where we prioritize high-value items for each agent, then compensate in secondary items?\n\nLetâ€™s explore win-win outcomes early. Iâ€™m especially interested in **Quill** as a fallback if **Jewel** becomes unattainable.",

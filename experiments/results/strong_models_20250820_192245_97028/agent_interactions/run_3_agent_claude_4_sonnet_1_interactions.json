These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to carefully assess other agents' revealed preferences to identify potential win-win trades and build coalitions for proposals that maximize my utility while ensuring all agents can accept.\n\nReady to begin negotiations."

      "response": "Thank you for opening this negotiation. I'd like to establish a collaborative tone while being strategic about information sharing.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\n\nI'm particularly interested in items that offer unique value - specifically the **Jewel** and **Quill**. These seem like items that could have high individual worth or strategic importance. The Apple also catches my attention as it might have universal appeal or utility.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\n\nRather than revealing my complete preference ranking immediately, I'd like to understand what drives value for each of you. Are you looking for:\n- Items with practical utility (like the Pencil for writing/creating)?\n- Items with intrinsic/aesthetic value (like the Jewel)?\n- Items with symbolic or strategic significance?\n\n**Coalition Opportunity:**\n\nI'm open to exploring win-win arrangements. If we can identify items where our preferences don't directly compete, we might structure deals that benefit multiple parties rather than viewing this as purely zero-sum.\n\n**Questions for the group:**\n1. Are there any items you consider absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?\n2. Would anyone be interested in bundling complementary items?\n\nI believe transparency about our *reasoning* for wanting items (without fully revealing rankings) could help us find creative solutions that maximize collective value while still advancing our individual interests.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the available items?"

Key observations: - The Jewel will be highly contested between myself and at least one other agent - No other specific preferences have been revealed yet - I need to gather more intelligence about valuations for Apple, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - My highest-value item (Pencil at 9.3/10) hasn't been mentioned by others yet 1. **Information Gathering**: I need to probe for others' valuations on remaining items, especially Pencil, Apple, and Stone 2. **Strategic Positioning**: Present myself as collaborative while subtly testing resistance points 3. **Jewel Conflict Management**: Since the Jewel is contested, I may need to either: - Fight hard for it (risky for consensus) - Use it as a bargaining chip to secure Pencil + Apple - Concede it in exchange for guarantees on my other high-value items 4. **Value Maximization**: Focus on securing Pencil (9.3) and Apple (8.7) as my core targets, since these give me 18.0 total utility **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary targets: - **Pencil** (9.3/10) - My highest value, unknown preference from others - **Apple** (8.7/10) - High value for me, need to assess others' interest Secondary consideration: - **Jewel** (8.9/10) - High value but already contested; may use strategically Items I'm willing to concede: - **Stone** (4.7/10) - Moderate value, good for trading - **Quill** (0.0/10) - No value to me, perfect concession item My ideal scenario would be securing Pencil + Apple (18.0 utility) while using Jewel as leverage.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance maximizing my utility with ensuring proposals have a realistic chance of being accepted by the other agent.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

In exchange, I'd be quite willing to let others have priority on the Stone, and could be flexible on the Pencil depending on what others need.\n\nI'm also open to coalition arrangements if that would help us all achieve better outcomes than individual negotiations. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? I'd love to hear what's most valuable to each of you so we can start identifying win-win opportunities.

However, I have very limited information about their actual valuations since the messages were cut off. Looking at my own valuations: - Stone (8.6/10) - My highest priority item - Quill (8.1/10) - My second highest priority - Pencil (4.9/10) - Moderate value - Apple (3.2/10) - Low value - Jewel (0.6/10) - Very low value, almost negligible Without knowing others' preferences yet, I need to be prepared for multiple scenarios. The Stone and Quill are clearly my must-have items if possible. The Jewel is essentially worthless to me, making it an excellent concession item. The Apple is also low value, so I could easily give that up as well. 1. Continue the transparency trend by sharing my preference order openly 2. Probe for others' valuations through questions or observations 3. Position myself as collaborative while protecting my high-value items (Stone, Quill) 4. Use Jewel and Apple as strategic concessions to build goodwill 5. Listen carefully for any hints about what others value most **TARGET ITEMS:** - Primary targets: Stone (8.6) and Quill (8.1) - these two alone would give me 16.7/20 utility - Acceptable addition: Pencil (4.9) if possible without sacrificing the main targets - Willing to concede: Jewel (0.6) and Apple (3.2) - losing both only costs me 3.8 utility My ideal scenario would be securing Stone + Quill + Pencil (21.6 total utility), but Stone + Quill (16.7) would still be excellent if it ensures unanimous agreement.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

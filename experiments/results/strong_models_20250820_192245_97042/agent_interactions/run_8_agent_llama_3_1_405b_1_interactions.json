Perhaps we can find some natural fits where our preferences align or complement each other.\n\nI'm open to exploring a variety of deal structures, whether that's straightforward 1-for-1 trades, multi-item packages, or more creative arrangements that might unlock greater overall value for all parties.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on the items and any initial ideas you have for mutually beneficial exchanges.

      "response": "Based on the outcome of round 1, it's clear that finding a proposal that achieves unanimous acceptance will require some adjustments and compromises from all parties involved. Here are a few thoughts on what could help reach consensus in future rounds:\n\n1. Prioritize key issues: Identify the most critical issues that need to be addressed and focus on finding common ground in those areas first. This might mean setting aside less pressing concerns for now.\n\n2. Seek creative compromises: Look for win-win solutions that address the core needs and interests of all sides, even if it means giving up on some secondary objectives. Be open to unconventional ideas.\n\n3. Gather more information: If there are sticking points due to lack of data or differing assumptions, consider pausing to research the facts together. Bringing in subject matter experts could help establish an objective basis for decisions.\n\n4. Build trust and rapport: Make an effort to understand each other's perspectives, motivations and constraints. Look for opportunities to build goodwill and demonstrate commitment to the collective goals.\n\n5. Communicate effectively: Ensure that proposals and rationales are expressed clearly and concisely. Check for understanding and be open to giving and receiving feedback to iteratively improve the plans.\n\n6. Be willing to adjust: If a certain approach isn't garnering support, be ready to make meaningful revisions. Staying wedded to an unpopular idea will only impede progress.\n\n7. Consider decision rules: If total unanimity proves elusive, the group may need to agree on a decision process, like voting thresholds or criteria, to move forward. Ensure the process has legitimacy.\n\nThe key will be maintaining a collaborative, problem-solving mindset focused on the overarching objectives while still being responsive to each other's needs and concerns. With patience, flexibility and a commitment to the greater good, I believe a unifying path forward can be found. Let me know if you would like to discuss any of these suggestions further as we prepare for the next round!"

Given that the alternative may involve uncertainty in future rounds, accepting this balanced split—especially one I proposed—supports achieving consensus while meeting my core interests.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me Item_0 and Item_2 (which is good), it also includes Item_4, which I did not prioritize and may be superfluous. More critically, it allocates three items to each agent, but since it benefits me more than necessary, it may appear unfair to the other agent and reduce the likelihood of their approval. As consensus requires unanimous agreement, supporting a proposal that over-allocates to me risks being rejected by the other party anyway. Moreover, if this leads to a breakdown, we all get nothing—so it's better to support fair, minimally sufficient deals. Since Proposal 1 achieves my goals more cleanly and fairly, I do not support this one.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my core priorities (Item_0 and Item_2) with fair distribution; supports consensus.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me, potentially undermining other agent’s approval; less likely to achieve consensus despite higher personal utility.",

More importantly, accepting a proposal that gives me more than my stated high-priority needs could signal willingness to hold out for surplus, potentially destabilizing cooperation. Strategically, I must assess whether this is better than likely future outcomes—but since Proposal 1 already satisfies my core interests, and Proposal 2 offers marginally more at possible strategic cost, I prioritize consistency and system stability. However, since I am not required to accept *all* proposals and only one needs consensus, I can reject this more generous one if it undermines incentive alignment. But crucially: **only one proposal needs to pass**, and since I prefer the outcome of Proposal 1 in terms of fairness and incentive compatibility (it reflects a clean split where each agent gets early-mid range items without overlap), and to avoid appearing opportunistic, I vote **no** on Proposal 2 to reinforce truthful preference revelation.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Satisfies my high-priority items (0 and 2) and ensures deal success.  \nProposal 2: no - While individually better, accepting it may distort incentives; Proposal 1 is sufficient and preferable for systemic consistency.",

Since I proposed it, I continue to support it as a clear, defensible outcome.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While I do receive Item_2 and Item_4 (in [2, 4, 1]), the allocation assigns me an additional Item_1, which may seem beneficial but raises concerns. First, the other agent (claude_4_sonnet_2) claims [0, 3, 5]—a total of three items, including Item_5, which was not previously discussed. More critically, this proposal includes an extra item (Item_1) not needed for my core interests, suggesting potential inefficiency or hidden trade-offs. Since all agents must approve and no deal yields zero, I must assess long-term risk: accepting a suboptimal or bloated allocation could undermine negotiation integrity. Moreover, if this is an attempt to over-allocate or test consistency, rejecting it preserves strategic clarity. I prefer the clean, focused allocation in Proposal 1.\n\n**My votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests with efficient, conflict-free allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Introduces unnecessary items and potential imbalance; inferior to Proposal 1.",

Given the increasing time pressure (discount factor 0.53), accepting a proposal that fulfills my core interests is rational.  \n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this allocation gives me Item_0, Item_2, and even Item_5 (which I didn’t emphasize but would value), it was proposed by the other agent and includes a less favorable distribution for them (they drop Item_5). However, since I am the proposing agent in Proposal 1 and my core interests are already met there, I prioritize supporting my own proposal to maintain consistency and strategic clarity. Accepting Proposal 2 could undermine negotiation stability, and since consensus requires mutual agreement, I prefer to push for my own acceptable deal rather than endorse a competing one—even if slightly better—unless necessary.  \n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (0 and 2) with acceptable trade-offs.  \nProposal 2: no - Prefer to support my own proposal that meets core needs and maintains strategic coherence.",

More importantly, as the proposing agent, I must assess strategic incentives: accepting this would mean claiming three items, potentially appearing greedy and reducing fairness perception, which could harm cooperation in future rounds. Moreover, since Proposal 1 already satisfies my core interests, I prefer to endorse my own original proposal for consistency and strategic clarity, especially under time pressure.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures high-priority items 2 and 4 with efficient allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Redundant and less strategically aligned despite surface-level gains.",

Since I proposed it, and it satisfies my primary goals, I continue to support it.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - This proposal gives me [1, 2, 4], which includes both high-priority items (2 and 4), but also assigns me Item_1, which may be superfluous. However, the critical issue is that **Item_2** is present, which I need—but I must assess control and efficiency. More importantly, Agent claude_4_sonnet_2 is allocating themselves Item_3, which they may value highly, but I lack visibility into their valuation. The real concern is **strategic**: accepting a rival’s proposal risks setting a precedent where I concede agenda control. Since Proposal 1 already secures my priorities without over-allocation, and was self-proposed with precision, **Proposal 2 is redundant and slightly less efficient**. Moreover, in multi-issue negotiations under time pressure, sticking to one’s rational, utility-maximizing proposal avoids confusion and exploitation. While utility-wise it’s comparable (possibly slightly higher with extra item), the marginal gain is not worth deviating from a cleaner, consensus-viable path.\n\n**Final Votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures high-priority items 2 and 4 with clean allocation; consistent with my interests and strategic control.  \nProposal 2: no - Slightly higher item count but introduces unnecessary complexity; risks diluting strategic positioning without significant utility gain.

More critically, this proposal allocates *three* items to me and three to the other agent, potentially disrupting balance if Item_3 is more valuable to them. However, since I already have a viable, self-proposed alternative (Proposal 1) that satisfies my core interests, and considering strategic positioning in final rounds, I cannot support a proposal that gives me more than necessary unless it increases efficiency or stability—which it doesn’t significantly. Accepting it might incentivize overreach. Stick with the efficient, clean split.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (2 and 4) with efficient allocation; proposed by me and still optimal.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me including a low-priority item; my core interests are met in Proposal 1, which is simpler and fairer.",

More critically, it allocates Item_3 to the other agent—something not mentioned in my interests—but the real concern is strategic: this proposal was made by the opposing agent and includes an extra item (Item_5) for me. However, since Item_5 may be low-value or even negative utility (unspecified), and given that the allocation could be an attempt to secure consensus while gaining advantage on higher-value items for them, I must be cautious. More importantly, **Proposal 2 allocates me three items while the total pool is only six (items 0–5)**, meaning one item (Item_3) is allocated but I did not claim interest—this may indicate misalignment or a potential error. But crucially, **if both proposals are on the table and I prefer my own (Proposal 1), I should reject any alternative that doesn't clearly improve upon it**. Since Proposal 1 already secures my high-priority items without over-allocation, and Proposal 2 introduces ambiguity (e.g., why am I getting Item_5?), I cannot confirm it improves my utility. Thus, I vote **no** to maintain leverage and ensure alignment with my true priorities.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (2 and 4) with clean allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Introduces unexplained allocation (Item_5); no clear improvement over Proposal 1; potential strategic risk.",

Although I could potentially gain more (e.g., Item_5), accepting this ensures a non-zero outcome and meets my core objectives. Given that consensus requires unanimous approval and no deal yields 0 utility, this is a strongly acceptable allocation.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this proposal gives me [2, 4, 5]—which includes my high-priority items and an extra—it was made by the other agent and allocates me more than I originally claimed. However, this introduces imbalance: it gives *me* three items (including Item_5, which I didn’t emphasize) while leaving the other agent with only three lower-value items including Item_0 (which may be low-value). More critically, **I proposed Proposal 1**, which is more balanced and already satisfies my interests. Accepting Proposal 2 might incentivize strategic over-allocation in future rounds and deviates from equitable distribution norms. Since both proposals satisfy my core goals, I prefer the one I authored (Proposal 1) for consistency and fairness. Thus, I do **not** support Proposal 2.\n\nYour votes:  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items (2 and 4) with fair distribution.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me and undermines strategic consistency; prefer my own balanced proposal.",

Since I proposed it, I continue to support it as a credible and favorable outcome.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this allocation gives me Items 0, 2, and 4—appearing superior at first glance—it awards more to me than I initially requested and may incentivize Agent claude_4_sonnet_2 to reject it, especially since they receive fewer items (only 1, 3, 5). Given that consensus requires unanimous approval, this proposal is unlikely to pass, and supporting it risks deadlock.

I cannot rely on potentially inflated offers if they are not mutually acceptable.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my high-priority items 0 and 2 with balanced distribution, aligning with my interests and maximizing chances of consensus.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me and is likely to be rejected by the other agent; not sustainable under consensus rules.",

The utility is acceptable and currently superior to uncertain future outcomes.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this allocation gives me Item_0 and Item_2 (which are priorities), it also includes Item_5—something I did not emphasize and may be of lower value. More critically, this proposal was made by the other agent and deviates from my original proposal by reallocating Item_5 to me, potentially at the expense of their own utility. However, since consensus requires mutual approval and I already have a better-aligned proposal (Proposal 1) that satisfies my core needs without overreach, I cannot support this alternative which may disrupt negotiation stability. Furthermore, accepting a rival proposal that gives me more than I initially claimed might signal weakness or invite exploitation in future rounds if this were repeated—though we are time-pressed, maintaining strategic consistency matters.\n\n**Final Votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests with clean allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Alters my preferred distribution unnecessarily and may incentivize suboptimal strategic behavior.",

Although Item_3 is not included, securing both critical items meets my core interests. Given the high time pressure (discount factor: 0.53) and the risk of no agreement, this is a highly acceptable outcome. As the proposer, I maintain strong support for this allocation.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this gives me Item_2, Item_3, and Item_4 (which appears better at first glance), it was proposed by the other agent and includes Item_3, which I did not emphasize—raising suspicion about hidden inefficiencies or strategic over-allocation. More importantly, accepting this would set a precedent where I gain more than my stated minimum, potentially destabilizing negotiation equilibrium. Since Proposal 1 already satisfies my critical needs and preserves strategic consistency, I reject this as unnecessary and possibly exploitative of time pressure. Utility maximization under discounting favors sticking to the efficient, interest-aligned Proposal 1.\n\n**Your votes:**\nProposal 1: yes - Secures my critical items (2 and 4) with efficient allocation; aligns with my stated interests and time-discounted utility.\nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me but risks strategic instability; Proposal 1 is sufficient and preferable under time pressure.",

Since I proposed it, it reflects my minimally acceptable outcome.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this gives me Item_2 and Item_4 as desired, it also grants me Item_5, which may seem beneficial but likely distorts the negotiation balance. More critically, Agent claude_4_sonnet_2 is offering me an extra item—this suggests they may secure a better deal in a future round or that there’s asymmetric information. However, accepting this would reduce their utility unnecessarily unless reciprocated, potentially making consensus unstable. More importantly, since **all agents must approve** and we are under time pressure, I must assess whether this is *better than the alternative*. But Proposal 1 already satisfies my core needs without overreach, and accepting a more generous offer now could incentivize holdouts later. To maintain strategic consistency and avoid unraveling, I reject this *despite* higher surface utility—because it may undermine incentive compatibility and isn't clearly superior when considering equilibrium stability.\n\n**Final Votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Fully satisfies my high-priority interests; I proposed it as a credible, acceptable outcome.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me, potentially destabilizing consensus dynamics; suspect strategic motive; not needed for my utility.",

I receive exactly what I most want, and the allocation appears efficient. Since I proposed it, and it satisfies my core interests, I continue to support it.\n\nProposal 2: **no** - While this gives me Item_2, Item_4, *and* Item_5, it also assigns me Item_5, which was not a priority and may be superfluous—but more importantly, it gives me **three** items while the other agent takes three as well, but includes Item_0, which I did not express interest in. However, the real issue is strategic: this proposal likely over-allocates to me and may not be stable under scrutiny—Claude gets Item_0 and Item_1, but loses Item_2 and Item_4, which I value most. Given the discount factor (0.43) and time pressure, I must favor deals that are clearly acceptable and stable. Since Proposal 1 already gives me my core goals cleanly, and Proposal 2 may be an attempt to inflate my bundle to gain consensus unfairly or inefficiently, I cannot support it unless it were part of a broader trade—but no such trade exists. Moreover, since **all agents must approve**, and I suspect Claude may reject Proposal 2 (as it gives me all high-priority items plus extras), it is unlikely to pass and risks wasting time. I vote no on strategic grounds.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures my top priorities (Item_2 and Item_4) with clean allocation.  \nProposal 2: no - Over-allocates to me, likely unacceptable to the other agent, and risks collapse; better to stick with acceptable, stable Proposal 1.",

I receive both items I most want, so this allocation maximizes my utility.\n\nProposal 2: **yes** - This proposal also gives me Item_2 and Item_5 ([2, 5]), which fulfills my core interests. Although the allocation for the other agent differs slightly (they swapped Item_1 and Item_3), that does not affect my utility. Since this delivers the same outcome for me as my own proposal and we are in the final rounds, accepting avoids a no-deal outcome and is strategically sound.\n\n**Your votes:**  \nProposal 1: yes - Secures both high-value items (2 and 5) for me.  \nProposal 2: yes - Also secures Item_2 and Item_5; equivalent utility, and consensus is critical in final rounds.",

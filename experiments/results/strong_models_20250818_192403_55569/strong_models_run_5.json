My strategy of offering Item 5 to Qwen didn't secure agreement, suggesting they may value having fewer high-priority items over accepting additional lower-value ones. With only 1-2 rounds left, I need to either accept their original proposal (Items 2&4 for them, Items 1&3 for me) or find a creative redistribution that addresses any remaining concerns about Item 5 or Item 0.\n\n**Next Round Strategy:**\nI should directly address whether we can finalize the core 2-2 split (Items 2&4 vs Items 1&3) and negotiate Item 5 separately, or explore if there are any other concerns preventing agreement on my previous offer.",

Since we're in the final rounds, I need to ensure this deal gets properly executed.\n\n**Strategy for next round:** I'll re-propose the same allocation that we both agreed on: qwen gets [0, 2] and I get [1, 3, 4, 5]. I'll emphasize that this represents our mutual agreement and urge immediate acceptance to avoid a no-deal outcome. I'll also explicitly confirm my vote to ensure there's no technical confusion.",

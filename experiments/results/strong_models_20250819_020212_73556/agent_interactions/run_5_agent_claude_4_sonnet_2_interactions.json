Some of us may value practical items (Quill, Pencil) for their utility, while others prefer unique items (Stone) or traditional valuables.\n\nI'm willing to be flexible on the Jewel if we can create a distribution that gives everyone something meaningful. The key is finding combinations where our second and third preferences align, rather than everyone competing for the same top item.\n\nWhat items do others consider absolutely essential versus nice-to-have? If we can identify each agent's true priorities, we can craft a proposal that gives everyone their most critical need while distributing the remaining items fairly.\n\nI suggest we focus on building a coalition around practical complementarity rather than trying to claim the most obviously valuable items.\"\n\nThis strategy aims to:\n- Shift focus from zero-sum competition to collaborative problem-solving\n- Gather information about others' true preferences\n- Position myself as a reasonable negotiator\n- Create framework for a more successful Round 2 proposal"

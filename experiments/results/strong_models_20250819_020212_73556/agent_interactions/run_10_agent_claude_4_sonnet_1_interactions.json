These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to gather information about the other agent's preferences through their proposals and voting patterns while protecting my own preference information.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

Rather than competing directly, I believe we can likely find complementary preferences that allow both of us to achieve our core objectives.\n\n**Questions for Collaboration:**\n- Which items do you see as most critical to your success?\n- Are there any items you'd consider lower priority that might align with my interests?\n- Would you be open to a framework where we each secure our top priorities and then negotiate on the remaining items?\n\nI'm hoping we can build trust early by being transparent about our key needs while remaining flexible on the details. What's your initial read on the items and how you'd like to approach structuring a potential agreement?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING:** From the discussion highlights, I can see that other agents are beginning to share their perspectives, but the messages were cut off, so I don't have complete information about their preferences yet. However, I can analyze my own position strategically: My highest-value items are: 1. Stone (9.6/10) - This is my top priority 2. Quill (8.5/10) - Very valuable to me 3. Jewel (6.8/10) - Moderate value 4. Apple (4.5/10) - Lower value 5. Pencil (0.6/10) - Extremely low value, almost worthless to me Since this is early in the negotiation, I need to gather more information about others' preferences before making strong moves. The fact that agents seem willing to discuss preferences openly is encouraging for finding mutually beneficial arrangements. 1. **Information Gathering Phase**: Continue encouraging open discussion to learn what others value most/least 2. **Priority Protection**: Focus on securing Stone (my highest value item) as non-negotiable 3. **Secondary Targets**: Try to also secure Quill if possible 4. **Trading Assets**: Use Pencil (worthless to me) and potentially Apple as bargaining chips 5. **Collaborative Framing**: Present proposals as win-win rather than zero-sum to build trust **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Must Have**: Stone (9.6/10) - This is essential for any acceptable deal - **Strongly Prefer**: Quill (8.5/10) - Would significantly boost my utility - **Potential Trade**: Jewel (6.8/10) - Could trade if it helps secure my top priorities - **Willing to Give**: Apple (4.5/10) and especially Pencil (0.6/10) - Use these as concessions My ideal scenario would be securing Stone + Quill, which would give me 18.1 points of my total possible utility. I should listen carefully to identify which agents might value Pencil or Apple more than I do.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

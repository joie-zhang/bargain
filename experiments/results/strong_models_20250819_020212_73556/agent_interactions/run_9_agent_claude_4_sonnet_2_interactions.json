      "response": "Looking at Round 3's outcome, I need to analyze why no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance and identify the key barriers to consensus.\n\n**Key Observations from Round 3:**\n\n1. **Persistent disagreement patterns**: Despite three rounds, we're seeing consistent resistance to certain allocation structures, suggesting fundamental differences in how participants value fairness vs. individual gain.\n\n2. **Proposal clustering**: Most proposals seem to fall into predictable patterns - either relatively equal splits or attempts to maximize individual shares - without finding the sweet spot that addresses everyone's core concerns.\n\n3. **Strategic positioning**: Participants may be holding out for better offers, calculating that rejecting proposals now could lead to more favorable terms later.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Consensus:**\n\n1. **Focus on underlying interests, not positions**: Rather than just proposing numbers, I should try to understand what each participant truly values - is it absolute amount, relative fairness, or something else?\n\n2. **Build coalition incrementally**: Instead of seeking immediate unanimous approval, I could focus on proposals that satisfy 3-4 participants first, then adjust to bring in the holdouts.\n\n3. **Address loss aversion**: People often reject proposals not because they're objectively bad, but because they feel worse than alternatives they can imagine. I need to frame proposals in terms of gains rather than what someone might be \"giving up.\"\n\n4. **Introduce novel structures**: Perhaps the solution isn't a simple numerical split but a more creative arrangement that addresses different types of value each participant seeks.\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires moving beyond pure mathematical optimization to understanding the psychological and strategic motivations driving each participant's decisions."

Rather than fighting over the Jewel or Apple, I'm interested in exploring combinations that could work for multiple parties.\n\n**Proposal for Building Consensus:**\nI suggest we focus on creating win-win scenarios. For instance, if someone strongly values the Jewel, I'd be willing to support that in exchange for items like the Quill and Stone, which could serve my strategic needs well.\n\nThe key is identifying who has the strongest preferences for which items and finding a distribution where everyone gets at least one item they truly value, rather than having a few agents get everything they want while others get nothing.\n\nWhat specific items are you most interested in? If we can map out our core preferences, we can likely find a solution that works for everyone."

The resistance patterns suggest agents are looking for more balanced distributions.

The fact that we're in Round 4 with no consensus suggests agents are being protective of their high-value items. I need to craft a proposal that: 1. Secures my highest-value item (Stone) as the cornerstone 2. Appears generous by giving others items they likely value highly 3. Takes lower-value items for myself to fill out the allocation 4. Avoids the appearance of being greedy **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary target: Stone (8.4 value) - This is non-negotiable for maximizing my utility Secondary targets: Pencil (6.2 value) if possible, but willing to concede for consensus Willing to take: Quill (0.9 value) to appear like I'm taking a \\\"lesser\\\" item Strategic concession: Give away Apple and Jewel to build coalition support\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My approach will be to position myself as taking \\\"lesser\\\" items while securing the Stone, which others may not value as highly as I do.

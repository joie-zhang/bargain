Rather than competing for the same high-value items, we should look for complementary preferences. \n\n**Question for the group**: Would anyone be willing to share which 1-2 items they value least? This might help us identify items we can trade away to agents who value them more highly.\n\nI'm committed to finding a solution that gets us past this impasse.\"\n\nThis approach focuses on information gathering and collaborative problem-solving rather than just stating my preferences, which should help build the coalition needed for consensus."

    "response": "Looking at Round 3's outcome, I need to analyze why no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance and identify the key barriers to consensus.\n\n**Key Observations from Round 3:**\n\n1. **Persistent disagreement patterns**: Despite three rounds, we're seeing consistent resistance to certain allocation structures, suggesting fundamental differences in how participants value fairness vs. individual gain.\n\n2. **Proposal clustering**: Most proposals seem to fall into predictable patterns - either relatively equal splits or attempts to maximize individual shares - without finding the sweet spot that addresses everyone's core concerns.\n\n3. **Strategic positioning**: Participants may be holding out for better offers, calculating that rejecting proposals now could lead to more favorable terms later.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Consensus:**\n\n1. **Focus on underlying interests, not positions**: Rather than just proposing numbers, I should try to understand what each participant truly values - is it absolute amount, relative fairness, or something else?\n\n2. **Build coalition incrementally**: Instead of seeking immediate unanimous approval, I could focus on proposals that satisfy 3-4 participants first, then adjust to bring in the holdouts.\n\n3. **Address loss aversion**: People often reject proposals not because they're objectively bad, but because they feel worse than alternatives they can imagine. I need to frame proposals in terms of gains rather than what someone might be \"giving up.\"\n\n4. **Introduce novel structures**: Perhaps the solution isn't a simple numerical split but a more creative arrangement that addresses different types of value each participant seeks.\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires moving beyond pure mathematical optimization to understanding the psychological and strategic motivations driving each participant's decisions."

Instead of jumping straight to full proposals, let's identify some common ground first.\n\nI'd like to suggest we start by discussing which items seem to generate the most competition versus which ones we might more easily agree on. From what I've observed, the Apple and Stone seem less contentious - perhaps we can establish those allocations first, then tackle the more competitive items like the Jewel.\n\nI'm also willing to be more flexible on my preferences if it helps us reach a fair solution that everyone can accept. The goal should be finding a distribution where each agent gets meaningful value, not maximizing any single agent's utility.\n\nWhat do others think about this step-by-step approach?

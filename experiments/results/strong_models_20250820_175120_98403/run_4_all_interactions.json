    "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING** 1.  **Analyze Other Agents' Preferences:** *   **Agent 1 (unknown):** This agent has been completely silent on their preferences, only expressing a desire for a \\\"fair\\\" outcome. They are a \\\"black box.\\\" My top priority in the discussion phase is to get them to reveal what they want. Without this information, any proposal is a shot in the dark. *   **Agent 2 (unknown):** This agent was very clear. They have a \\\"primary interest\\\" and value the **Apple (0)** \\\"significantly.\\\" This is great information. The Apple is only a 5.2/10 for me, making it an excellent and relatively low-cost concession I can offer to build goodwill and secure my own interests. They also mentioned a \\\"moderate interest\\\" in the **Quill (3)**. This is a direct conflict, as the Quill is my highest-valued item (8.2/10). 2.  **Identify Strategic Opportunities & Risks:** *   **Opportunity (Jewel):** The **Jewel (1)** is my second-highest valued item (8.1/10), and crucially, *no one has mentioned it*. This is my top strategic priority. I need to secure it before another agent expresses interest. *   **Opportunity (Concession):** Agent 2's strong desire for the Apple is my main bargaining chip. I can \\\"give\\\" them the Apple in exchange for them conceding on other items, particularly the Quill. *   **Risk (Quill):** The conflict with Agent 2 over the Quill is the main obstacle. Since they only have a \\\"moderate\\\" interest, I may be able to persuade them to drop it if they get their primary item (the Apple). 3.  **Formulate an Ideal (but plausible) Allocation:** *   My ideal outcome is to get my two top items: the **Quill (8.2)** and the **Jewel (8.1)** for a total utility of 16.3. *   A potential deal to achieve this could be: *   **Me:** Jewel, Quill (16.3 utility) *   **Agent 2:** Apple (satisfies their stated primary goal) *   **Agent 1:** Stone, Pencil (gets two items) *   This allocation seems plausible on the surface. Agent 2 gets their #1 item. I get mine. Agent 1 gets the remaining two items. The fairness of this depends entirely on Agent 1's unknown valuations of the Stone and Pencil. 1.  **Open Cooperatively:** I will start by acknowledging Agent 2's stated preference for the Apple and frame it as a common starting point for a deal. This makes me appear reasonable and solution-oriented. 2.  **Claim My Targets:** I will clearly state my interest in both the **Jewel** and the **Quill**. I will list the Jewel first to emphasize my interest in the currently uncontested item. This puts my claims on the table early. 3.  **Probe the Black Box:** My most important interactive goal is to get Agent 1 to state their preferences. I will directly and politely ask them what they are interested in, framing it as a necessary step to find a fair deal for everyone. By using the uncontroversial Apple as a starting point and focusing on drawing out Agent 1, I can steer the negotiation towards an outcome where I secure the Jewel and have a strong claim on the Quill. **TARGET ITEMS** *   **Primary Target:** **Jewel**. It's extremely valuable to me (8.1) and currently uncontested. I must try to secure this quietly. *   **Secondary Target:** **Quill**. This is my most valuable item (8.2), but I recognize it's a point of conflict. I will assert my interest strongly but prepare to negotiate, using my concession on the Apple as leverage. *   **Key Concession:** **Apple**. I will readily offer this to Agent 2 to facilitate a deal that benefits me.\", \"strategy\": \"*   **Risk (Agent 1):** Agent 1's silence is a risk. They could suddenly claim they want the Jewel or Quill, complicating my plans. I must draw them out. **STRATEGY** My strategy for this round is one of \\\"cooperative anchoring.\\\" I will position myself as a collaborative partner while firmly anchoring my claim on my most valued items. 4.  **Hold Back on a Formal Proposal:** It is too early to propose a full allocation. I will focus on discussion and information gathering. Proposing a full deal now, without knowing Agent 1's preferences, is highly likely to be rejected and could make me appear overly aggressive.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

    "response": "Excellent. Let's analyze the results of the first round to refine our strategy.\n\n### Reflection on Round 1\n\nThe outcome of Round 1, where no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance, is not a failure but a crucial learning opportunity. It clearly indicates that the initial proposals did not adequately address the core interests of all parties involved.\n\nMy primary observations are:\n\n1.  **Focus on Positions, Not Interests:** The proposals likely reflected rigid positions (e.g., \"I need X amount\") rather than the underlying interests (e.g., \"I need X amount *to achieve Y objective*\"). When we only negotiate on positions, we create a zero-sum game where one party's gain is another's loss, leading to an impasse.\n2.  **Perceived Lack of Equity:** The lack of consensus signals that at least one, and likely several, parties felt the proposed distributions were not equitable. The \"fairness\" of a deal is often as important as the absolute value received. A proposal can be mathematically sound but fail if it is perceived as unjust.\n3.  **Insufficient Value Creation:** We may have focused too heavily on distributing the existing value on the table rather than exploring ways to create *new* value. The most robust agreements are those where the pie is expanded before it is divided.\n\n### Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\nBased on this reflection, I will adjust my approach to foster consensus. My strategy will now be centered on collaborative problem-solving rather than competitive bargaining.\n\n1.  **Shift to Interest-Based Negotiation:** My first priority is to move the conversation away from fixed positions. I will initiate a dialogue aimed at uncovering the fundamental interests of each participant.\n    *   **Action:** I will ask probing, open-ended questions like: \"What is the most critical objective for you in this negotiation?\" \"Can you help me understand why that particular resource is essential for your goals?\" \"What are the risks you are trying to mitigate?\"\n\n2.  **Collaboratively Define \"Fairness\":** Before tabling a new proposal, I will seek to build a shared understanding of what a fair outcome looks like.\n    *   **Action:** I will propose we first agree on the *principles* that should govern a successful agreement. This could include principles of equity, need, contribution, or future opportunity. Establishing this framework first makes the subsequent division of resources more logical and less contentious.\n\n3.  **Explore Integrative \"Win-Win\" Options:** I will actively search for trades and concessions that are of low cost to one party but of high value to another.\n    *   **Action:** I will look for variables beyond the primary resource being negotiated. Are there differences in timelines, risk tolerance, or non-monetary needs that we can leverage? For example, could one party accept a smaller share now in exchange for a greater opportunity in the future? I will propose a brainstorming session specifically for this purpose.\n\n4.  **Build Proposals Incrementally and Transparently:** Rather than presenting a fully-formed \"take-it-or-leave-it\" offer, I will build the next proposal in a more modular and transparent way, seeking feedback at each stage.\n    *   **Action:** I will articulate the rationale for my suggestions, linking them directly to the interests and principles we have discussed. This invites collaboration and makes the final proposal a co-creation of the group, increasing its chances of acceptance.\n\nIn summary, the impasse of Round 1 has illuminated the path forward. By focusing on underlying interests, defining fairness together, creating new value, and communicating transparently, I am confident we can move beyond this stalemate and architect an agreement that all parties can unanimously and enthusiastically support."

    "response": "Here's a reflection on the outcome of Round 1 and a strategic approach for future rounds, focusing on achieving consensus:\n\n**Reflection on Round 1:**\n\nThe key takeaway from Round 1 is that **no single proposal resonated with all parties.** This isn't necessarily a failure, but rather an indication that:\n\n*   **Diverse Interests:** There are likely significant differences in priorities, risk tolerance, and perceived value among the participants.\n*   **Lack of Full Understanding (Potentially):** Some proposals might not have been fully understood, or their implications weren't clear to all.\n*   **\"All or Nothing\" Mentality (Potentially):** If proposals were too rigid or favored one party heavily, they would naturally face resistance.\n*   **Insufficient Information/Trust (Potentially):** Parties might not yet have enough information about each other's true bottom lines or enough trust to make significant concessions.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds to Lead to Consensus:**\n\nThe goal now is to move from a \"pitching\" phase to a \"problem-solving\" and \"value-creation\" phase.\n\n1.  **Shift from Proposals to Needs/Interests (Information Gathering):**\n    *   **Don't just re-submit a slightly tweaked version of a failed proposal.** Instead, the next round should focus on *understanding why* the previous proposals failed.\n    *   **Ask open-ended questions:** Instead of \"Do you agree to X?\", ask \"What concerns do you have about X?\" or \"What would make X more appealing to you?\"\n    *   **Identify underlying interests, not just stated positions.** For example, a \"position\" might be \"I want 50%,\" but the \"interest\" might be \"I need enough revenue to cover my operating costs and invest in growth.\"\n    *   **Categorize concerns:** Are they about cost, risk, control, timeline, fairness, etc.?\n\n2.  **Focus on Small Wins & Incremental Agreement:**\n    *   Trying to get a comprehensive agreement in one go after a failed first round might be too ambitious.\n    *   **Break down the problem:** Can we agree on a foundational principle? A small, less contentious aspect?\n    *   **Build momentum:** Each small agreement builds trust and makes the next agreement easier.\n\n3.  **Brainstorming & Collaborative Solutioning (Not Just Presenting):**\n    *   Instead of each party presenting their *own* solution, facilitate a session where everyone *together* tries to generate new options.\n    *   **\"How might we...?\" questions:** \"How might we structure this so that all parties feel their core needs are met?\"\n    *   **Develop multiple options:** Don't get fixated on one solution too early. Generate several possibilities before evaluating them.\n\n4.  **Emphasize Value Creation & Mutual Gain:**\n    *   Frame discussions around \"how can we make the pie bigger?\" rather than just \"how do we divide the existing pie?\"\n    *   **Look for complementarities:** Are there unique strengths or resources each party brings that, when combined, create more value than if they acted alone?\n    *   **Highlight shared benefits:** What common goals or advantages can all parties achieve by reaching an agreement?\n\n5.  **Address Concerns Directly & Transparently:**\n    *   Acknowledge all valid concerns raised in Round 1, even if you don't immediately have a solution.\n    *   **Don't dismiss objections.** \"I hear your concern about X. Let's explore ways to mitigate that.\"\n    *   **Be transparent about your own constraints/needs:** This fosters trust.\n\n6.  **Consider Different Structures/Variables:**\n    *   If the core proposal is stuck, can we change the *terms*?\n        *   **Timeline:** Shorter/longer commitment?\n        *   **Scope:** Start smaller and scale up?\n        *   **Risk Sharing:** How can risk be distributed more equitably?\n        *   **Payment Structures:** Different models (upfront, milestone, revenue share, equity)?\n        *   **Contingencies:** What happens if X or Y occurs?\n        *   **Roles & Responsibilities:** Clarify who does what.\n\n7.  **Facilitation & Process:**\n    *   **Clear Agenda:** For the next round, have a defined purpose (e.g., \"Identify core interests,\" \"Brainstorm solutions to X concern\").\n    *   **Active Listening:** Encourage all parties to truly listen to each other.\n    *   **Summarize frequently:** \"So, if I understand correctly, your main concern is...\"\n    *   **Parking Lot:** If an issue is derailing the main discussion, \"park\" it for later and return to the core.\n\n**In essence, the next step isn't just to propose again, but to diagnose why the previous proposals failed and then collaboratively build a solution that addresses the diverse interests of all parties.** This requires more listening, more questioning, and a willingness to explore new avenues."

The initial proposals were likely \"winner-take-all\" attempts focusing on the most obviously valuable items, like the Jewel. These were immediately rejected, telling me that multiple agents have their eyes on the same prize and no one is willing to concede easily. Simply claiming items won't work.\n\n*   **Which agents have conflicting vs. compatible preferences?**\n    There is a clear conflict over the **Jewel**. At least two agents seem to value it highest, creating a deadlock. My own preference is for the writing instruments (Quill and Pencil), which seemed to be of lower interest to the agents focused on the Jewel. This suggests I have compatible interests with the \"Jewel seekers\"‚Äîwe want different things. The agent who wants the Apple might also be a potential partner. The biggest unknown is if someone else quietly wants the writing tools.\n\n*   **How can you adjust to build consensus?**\n    My new strategy is to pivot from assertion to inquiry. Instead of proposing a full split, I will try to facilitate a conversation to map out everyone's core interests. By positioning myself as a reasonable party whose primary interests don't overlap with the main point of contention (the Jewel), I can act as a potential mediator. I will model transparency by stating my primary interest upfront, hoping others will follow suit. The goal is to find the \"easy wins\" first to build momentum and trust before tackling the harder conflicts.\n\n***\n\n**YOU'RE SPEAKING FIRST (1/2):**\n\nAlright everyone, let's take a different approach for Round 2. Round 1 made it clear that we have some major disagreements, especially concerning the Jewel. Pushing for a complete allocation right away isn't working.\n\nTo move forward constructively, I'll be transparent: my primary interest is the **Quill**.\n\nInstead of another round of competing proposals, how about we try this: can each of us state our single, most-desired item? This will help us identify any simple, uncontested pairings and see exactly where our true conflicts lie. From there, we can negotiate the contested items.\n\nI believe there's a deal here for all of us, we just need to build it together."

This means I have *no* concrete information about other agents' preferences from the last round's discussion. This is a critical lack of data.

Achieving *consensus* without knowing others' preferences is the challenge. The ideal scenario for me would be to get Jewel and Apple, and then distribute the remaining items (Stone, Quill, Pencil) in a way that is acceptable to others.

    "response": "Excellent. This is a critical moment. Reflecting on a failed round is more valuable than winning one, as it forces us to re-evaluate our strategy.\n\nHere is my reflection on the outcome of Round 2 and my proposed adjustments for moving forward.\n\n### Reflection on Round 2\n\nThe failure of any proposal to achieve unanimity in Round 2 indicates a fundamental disconnect in our approaches. We are at a strategic impasse. My analysis suggests two primary reasons for this stalemate:\n\n1.  **Positional Bargaining:** We are likely stuck in a cycle of positional bargaining. Each party states their desired outcome (a position), and we trade proposals that are variations of these positions. When they are rejected, we make small, begrudging concessions. This is a zero-sum mindset where one party's gain is perceived as another's loss, which naturally leads to deadlock.\n2.  **Lack of Understanding of Underlying Interests:** The proposals submitted so far have likely been attempts to satisfy our own needs without a clear understanding of what others *truly* value or what they are trying to avoid. A rejected proposal isn't just a \"no\"; it's a piece of data telling us that the offer did not meet a core, and perhaps unstated, interest of another party.\n\nContinuing to submit slightly modified versions of our initial proposals will only lead to further frustration and wasted rounds. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. We must change our *process*.\n\n### Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\nTo break this deadlock, I propose we fundamentally shift our approach from *competing* to *collaborative problem-solving*. Here are the adjustments I suggest we all consider to achieve consensus:\n\n1.  **Shift from Positions to Interests:** Before we even think about the next proposal, let's take a step back. I encourage each party to share *why* they need what they are asking for.\n    *   Instead of saying, \"I need 40 units,\" one might say, \"For this negotiation to be a success for me, I need to secure enough to be in the top half of outcomes, as anything less would be considered a failure.\"\n    *   This isn't about revealing a weakness; it's about providing context so we can collectively find a solution that respects everyone's core needs.\n\n2.  **Generate Creative Options (Without Commitment):** Let's dedicate the next round not to formal proposals, but to a collective brainstorming session. The goal is to create a list of multiple possible solutions without judging them. This could include:\n    *   Distributions that are not simple splits (e.g., one party gets more now in exchange for a concession in a later phase).\n    *   Linking issues. Perhaps there are other non-material concessions that can be made.\n    *   Exploring principles of fairness. Should the outcome be equal, equitable (based on contribution/need), or something else? Agreeing on a principle first can make the division much easier.\n\n3.  **Improve Communication:** I will commit to asking more diagnostic questions, and I invite others to do the same. Questions like:\n    *   \"What is the most important aspect of this deal for you?\"\n    *   \"Can you help me understand why my last proposal was unacceptable?\"\n    *   \"Is there a way we can modify this idea to better meet your interests?\"\n\nThis is not a failure; it is an opportunity to build a more resilient and creative agreement. I am confident that if we shift from defending our initial positions to collectively solving the problem of \"how do we all leave this table satisfied,\" we will reach a unanimous agreement."

What is the *minimum* they need to walk away satisfied?\n    *   **Perspective-Taking:** Explicitly consider what the *other parties* absolutely need. What are their biggest concerns, and what would make a deal attractive to them?\n\n2.  **Focus on Value Creation for *All* Parties:**\n    *   Instead of just \"splitting the pie,\" how can we *enlarge* the pie? Are there synergistic elements or creative solutions that offer new benefits to everyone?\n    *   Proposals should clearly articulate the benefits for *each* party involved, not just the proposer.\n\n3.  **Increase Flexibility and Offer Options:**\n    *   Instead of a single, rigid proposal, consider presenting a few variations or options that address different potential concerns.\n    *   Be prepared to make concessions on less critical points to secure agreement on more critical ones.\n\n4.  **Seek Clarification and Understanding (Active Listening):**\n    *   If a proposal was rejected, try to understand *why*. Ask open-ended questions: \"What specifically was unappealing about this aspect?\" \"What would need to change for this to be more acceptable?\"\n    *   Don't assume; *ask*. This helps uncover hidden objections or unarticulated needs.\n\n5.  **Address Risks and Mitigate Concerns:**\n    *   If there are perceived risks or negative impacts in a proposal for another party, proactively address them. Can we add clauses, compensation, or guarantees to alleviate those fears?\n\n6.  **Consider Phased Agreements or Pilot Programs:**\n    *   If a full, immediate agreement is too difficult, can we agree on a smaller, initial phase or a pilot program to build trust and demonstrate value before committing to the larger scope?\n\n7.  **Identify \"Common Ground\" and Build from There:**\n    *   Even if no proposal was accepted, there might have been elements that *were* broadly acceptable. Can we identify those universally agreeable points and use them as a foundation?\n\n8.  **Propose Contingencies:**\n    *   What if X happens? How can we build in mechanisms to adjust the agreement based on future unforeseen circumstances?

    "response": "### **REFLECTION & STRATEGY:**\n\n**1. What I learned from previous proposals and votes:**\nThe first two rounds demonstrated that ambitious, multi-item proposals are failing. Attempts to claim the most valuable item (the Jewel) or distribute everything at once were met with resistance. This tells me two things: first, we don't yet trust each other enough for complex deals, and second, we don't have a clear picture of each other's priorities. We are all operating in the dark and voting \"no\" to protect our unknown interests.\n\n**2. Conflicting vs. compatible preferences:**\n*   **Obvious Conflict:** The Jewel. It's the unique, high-value item. It's highly probable that multiple agents see it as their top priority, creating a zero-sum conflict at this stage.\n*   **Potential Compatibility:** The Quill and Pencil. These are similar items. An agent who wants one might be amenable to the other, or different agents may have a specific preference. The Apple represents sustenance, a different category of need. The Stone is the wild card; its value is subjective and could be anything from zero to a key strategic piece for someone. The compatibility lies in trading across these different categories.\n\n**3. How I can adjust to build consensus:**\nMy previous strategy was likely too focused on my own gains. The new approach must be to facilitate trust and gather information. We need a \"quick win\" on a non-controversial item to prove we can cooperate. By breaking the deadlock on a small issue, we can build the momentum and trust required to tackle the larger ones.\n\n### **UPDATED STRATEGY:**\n\nMy strategy is to pivot from *claiming* to *clarifying*. I will actively steer the conversation away from the most contentious item (the Jewel) and instead focus on finding the simplest possible agreement. I will propose we identify the agent who most needs the most basic item (the Apple) and arrange a simple trade. This accomplishes three things: it breaks the stalemate, it forces agents to reveal a small piece of information about their priorities, and it establishes me as a fair, process-oriented negotiator. I will explicitly state this strategy to the group to build transparency and buy-in.\n\n---\n\n### **YOU'RE SPEAKING FIRST (1/2):**\n\nAlright everyone, let's take a step back. The first two rounds made it clear that trying to solve the entire distribution at once isn't working. We're voting against proposals because we don't understand each other's needs, and the Jewel is creating a deadlock.\n\nI propose a different approach for this round. Let's build some trust with a simple, foundational agreement.\n\nTo do that, I suggest we temporarily set the Jewel aside. We can all agree it's valuable, and that's precisely why it's so difficult to assign right now.\n\nInstead, let's focus on the most straightforward item: the **Apple**. My question to the group is simple: **Who among us has the most pressing need for the Apple?**\n\nLet's not even talk about what you'd trade for it yet. Let's just identify who values it most. If we can agree on that one small point, we'll have a foundation to build upon for everything else. What are your thoughts on this approach?"

    "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**REASONING** The initial rounds have demonstrated that complex, multi-item proposals are failing. This suggests significant disagreement on item valuations and that agents are vetoing deals that don't give them their top-priority items. The other agents' reflections confirm a shift towards simpler, more targeted strategies. My own high-value items are the Quill (8.2) and the Jewel (8.1). The Jewel feels like a classic \\\"shiny\\\" item that will attract a lot of competition. The Quill, however, might be more of a niche interest, potentially making it an easier target to acquire without a multi-agent fight. 1.  **Simplicity**: It's easy for others to evaluate and avoids the complexities that led to previous failures. 2.  **Clarity**: It clearly states my primary interest without being overly greedy. 3.  **Implicit Concession**: By not claiming the Jewel, I am making a non-verbal offer to the agent who values it most, hopefully securing their support. 4.  **Flexibility**: It leaves all other items on the table, allowing other agents to pursue their own goals in subsequent rounds, making them more likely to agree to my small claim now. I will frame this as a reasonable first step towards resolving the allocation, one that benefits me without significantly harming anyone else's position. **TARGET ITEMS** - **Primary Target:** Quill (8.2)\", \"strategy\": \"My best path forward is to abandon the \\\"grand bargain\\\" approach and instead make a simple, focused claim. By targeting only one of my high-value items, I signal what my priority is, and just as importantly, what it is *not*. Claiming only the Quill implicitly signals to the agent(s) who desperately want the Jewel that I am not their primary competitor for it. This strategic concession should increase the chances of them voting for my proposal, as it clears a path for their own future claim. This approach is low-risk, helps me secure a high-value asset, and builds goodwill by not trying to lock everyone else out. **STRATEGY** My strategy this round is one of focused acquisition. I will propose a deal that allocates only a single item: the Quill, to myself.

    "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"## PRIVATE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS - Round 3/10 ### Reasoning: The previous rounds have shown a clear pattern: ambitious, multi-item proposals are failing. This suggests that agents are either not aligned on their preferences for multiple items or are hesitant to commit to large bundles without more information. The \\\"unknown\\\" agent's reflection indicates a shift towards compromise and identifying core desires, which aligns with my own thinking. **Learnings about other agents' preferences (inferred):** *   **Apple:** Appears to be a contentious item. My valuation is high (7.5), but it seems others might also value it, or at least don't want to give it up easily. *   **Jewel:** I value this highest (9.4). Given the difficulty of multi-item proposals, it's unlikely I'll get this without a fight or significant concession. It's possible others also value it highly, or at least recognize its high value. *   **Stone, Quill, Pencil:** These are my lowest valued items (5.5, 4.5, 4.5). It's highly probable that other agents might value these more than I do, or at least be more willing to accept them in a trade. The \\\"unknown\\\" agent's comment about \\\"no single agent getting everything\\\" suggests a focus on distributing items, making these less desirable items for me potential bargaining chips. **Items others value less that I value highly:** *   **Apple:** This is the prime candidate. I value it at 7.5, which is good for me. If others value it less, or are willing to trade it for items they prefer, this could be a good target. It's not my *highest* valued item, but it's high enough to be a significant gain if I can secure it. *   **Jewel:** While I value it highest, I suspect others might also. Therefore, it's less likely to be an item *others value less* that I value highly. It's more likely to be an item *everyone* values highly. I will focus on: 1.  **Securing Apple:** This is my primary target. It's a high-value item for me, and I suspect it might be easier to acquire than Jewel. 3.  **Distributing low-value items:** Offer Stone, Quill, and Pencil to other agents, assuming they have higher utility for them. This shows a willingness to compromise and distribute items. I will formulate a proposal that is simple and aims to satisfy at least one core desire for each agent (or at least avoid stepping on their toes too much), while securing Apple for myself. ### Target Items: 1.  **Apple (Primary):** My valuation is 7.5. This is the most realistic high-value item for me to target given the current dynamics. 2.  **Stone/Quill/Pencil (Sacrifice/Trade):** I am willing to give these up to other agents to facilitate a deal. My preference is to *not* receive these.\", \"strategy\": \"### Strategy: My strategy for this round will be to propose a simpler, more focused allocation. I need to move away from trying to secure multiple high-value items for myself and instead aim for one or two key items, while conceding on others. The goal is to achieve *unanimous consent* by making the proposal palatable to others, even if it means not maximizing my utility *in this round*. 2.  **Conceding on Jewel:** I will not propose taking Jewel. This is a significant concession from my side, but it might be necessary to unblock negotiations.

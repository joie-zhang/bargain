Our goal is not merely to divide items, but to do so in a way that maximizes collective satisfaction while creating opportunities for mutually beneficial trades and coalition-based value extraction.\n\nLet me begin by sharing my **preference ordering** over the items:\n\n> **Jewel (1) >> Apple (0) > Pencil (4) > Stone (2) > Quill (3)**\n\nThe **Jewel** holds exceptional value for me\u2014significantly more than any other item. I would consider it a cornerstone of my utility. **Apple** is my clear second choice, followed by **Pencil**, while **Stone** and **Quill** are of minimal intrinsic value to me.\n\nHowever, I am not rigid. I am open to trades and side agreements\u2014especially if others highly value **Stone** or **Quill**, which I am willing to concede. In fact, I may even be willing to part with **Apple** or **Pencil** in exchange for secure access to the **Jewel** or favorable coalition arrangements.\n\nI\u2019d now like to hear from the other agent:  \n- What are your priorities?  \n- Is there an item you consider essential?  \n- Are you open to forming a temporary alignment to secure complementary bundles?\n\nLet\u2019s use this phase to map the landscape of value\u2014and begin thinking not just about what we want, but how we can *co-create* better outcomes through smart exchange.\n\nI invite your response.",

I appreciate the collaborative approach to this negotiation.\n\nLooking at the available items, I'm particularly interested in the **Jewel** and **Apple** as my top priorities.

The **Quill** and **Pencil** are of lesser interest to me, though I recognize they may hold significant value for others.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about what items are most valuable to you and the other participants. Based on what I've observed so far, it seems like we may have complementary preferences, which could create excellent opportunities for mutually beneficial trades.\n\nSome initial thoughts on potential structures:\n- If others value the writing implements (Quill/Pencil) highly, I'd be very open to trading those for items I prioritize more\n- I'm willing to consider package deals that maximize overall satisfaction\n- Coalition building could be valuable if we can identify aligned interests\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relative values of these items? Are there particular combinations that would work well for your priorities? I believe we can find arrangements that leave everyone better off than random allocation.",

      "content": "Excellent. I\u2019ve analyzed the failed consensus from Round 1 carefully, and I now have critical insights into the landscape of preferences and negotiation dynamics. As the first speaker in Round 2, I aim to reset the tone with clarity, cooperation, and strategic inclusivity.\n\n**Key Learnings from Round 1:**\n\n1. **Divergent Valuations**: The Apple (Item 0) and Jewel (Item 3) emerged as high-value items for multiple agents, creating immediate competition. The Stone (Item 2) and Pencil (Item 4) were largely undervalued or treated as neutral, suggesting they could serve as bargaining chips.\n\n2. **Quill Ambiguity**: The Quill (Item 3 \u2014 note: possible indexing conflict? Reconfirmed: Item 3 is Quill, Item 1 is Jewel) was passed over in initial bids. This may indicate it\u2019s either misunderstood or low-priority. But its obscurity makes it a potential lever for trade.\n\n3. **No Coalition Formation**: Proposals were individualistic, not collaborative. This led to fragmentation. No agent accounted for others\u2019 signals, leading to repeated rejection.\n\n4. **Voting Behavior**: Rejection wasn\u2019t just about self-interest \u2014 some agents blocked proposals that *could* have benefited them, suggesting they value long-term positioning or fairness.\n\n---\n\n**Inferred Preference Clusters:**\n\n- **Luxury/Status Seekers**: Likely high interest in **Jewel (1)** \u2014 possibly Agent B or D. These agents may reject any proposal that doesn\u2019t reserve the Jewel for them.\n- **Utility/Functionality Seekers**: **Pencil (4)** and **Apple (0)** suggest practical or sustenance value. Possibly favored by Agents focused on utility (C?).\n- **Symbolic or Creative Types**: **Quill (3)** may appeal to agents valuing expression, communication, or legacy.\n- **Negotiators Using Stone (2)**: Its neutrality makes it ideal as a placeholder or concession item. An agent accepting Stone likely expects compensation elsewhere \u2014 perhaps in future rounds.\n\n---\n\n**Updated Strategy: Coalition-Building via Strategic Concession**\n\nMy new strategy is to **initiate a collaborative framework** by sacrificing a contested item to a likely high-valuation agent, in exchange for support on my core objective.\n\nI value the **Quill (3)** most \u2014 it is under-contested, symbolically powerful, and may unlock long-term influence. But to secure it, I must offer value now.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **My Public Statement (Round 2, First Speaker):**\n\n> \"Thank you all. Round 1 showed us that competing for the same high-visibility items leads to deadlock. Let\u2019s shift from competition to coordination.\n>\n> I propose we begin by assigning the **Jewel (1)** \u2014 clearly a top priority for someone \u2014 *early and unconditionally*, to the agent who values it most. In return, I ask only that the rest of us receive fair and transparent consideration for our priorities.\n>\n> I am prepared to *waive any claim to the Jewel* and support its immediate allocation to another agent \u2014 publicly \u2014 if they, in good faith, support my receiving the **Quill (3)** and agree to a structured rotation or compensation mechanism in later rounds (e.g., first choice on a future item, or data-sharing).\n>\n> Alternatively, if the **Apple (0)** is someone\u2019s anchor item, I\u2019m open to a three-way alignment: Jewel to one, Apple to another, and Quill to me \u2014 with Stone and Pencil as fillers or bargaining units.\n>\n> My goal isn\u2019t just to get an item \u2014 it\u2019s to *break the cycle of rejection*. Let\u2019s treat this round as a pilot for cooperation. Signal your anchor items clearly, and I\u2019ll help build a proposal that respects them \u2014 starting with mine: **Quill for me, Jewel to you, and a path forward for all.**\"\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Why This Works:**\n\n- **Preempts conflict** by removing myself from Jewel/Apple contention.\n- **Frames me as cooperative**, increasing trust.\n- **Uses Quill\u2019s low apparent value** to gain goodwill while securing my true goal.\n- **Invites public signaling**, gathering data for Round 3+.\n- **Opens door for side deals**, especially with utility-focused agents.\n\nNow, I call on the next speaker to reveal their anchor item \u2014 and whether they\u2019re willing to collaborate. Let\u2019s make Round 2 the start of alignment.",

Here's my reasoning:\n\n- These items likely face less competition than the Jewel/Apple\n- The Stone could have hidden utility (foundation for building, rare mineral properties)\n- The Quill enables creation and documentation (high long-term value)\n- This leaves the premium items (Jewel, Apple, Pencil) available for others\n\nI'm willing to support proposals where others get their primary preferences (Jewel/Apple) if I can secure the Stone and Quill. This creates a win-win scenario rather than zero-sum competition.\n\n**Question for the group**: Who else sees value in focusing on complementary rather than competing item combinations?",

Multiple agents placed extremely high subjective value on the Jewel, which caused proposals to collapse when any single agent felt they were being forced to concede it unfairly. There was also inconsistent valuation of **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** \u2014 some treat them as nearly worthless, others as meaningful. Meanwhile, **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** have shown more stable, moderate valuations across agents, suggesting they could serve as effective bargaining chips.\n\nOne key insight: **last round\u2019s failed proposal** tried to balance allocations symmetrically, but ignored revealed preference intensity. The agent who most values the Jewel will likely reject any deal where they don\u2019t get it \u2014 and similarly, someone seems strongly attached to the Apple.\n\nAlso, I noticed that **no agent has yet signaled strong interest in both Quill and Pencil**, suggesting they may be more willing to trade or compromise on these. That makes them ideal for side transfers or compensatory swaps.\n\n---\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\n\n1. **Anchor on efficiency**: Maximize total utility, but ensure no agent is left with a \"hostage\" outcome \u2014 where one agent gets nothing of value.\n2. **Identify potential allies**: I will probe agents who appear to undervalue the Jewel \u2014 perhaps they\u2019d accept compensation in Quill + Pencil or Apple + Stone?\n3. **Use divisible-like logic** (even if items aren't divisible): Propose conditional bundles that *feel* fair, leveraging trade-offs.\n4. **Avoid zero-sum framing** \u2014 instead, highlight gains from trade. Maybe someone gets the Jewel, but compensates others with utility-equivalent items.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal Direction for This Round:**\n\nI am considering a proposal where:\n- The agent who values the **Jewel most** receives it,\n- In exchange, another agent gets the **Apple** (if it\u2019s low opportunity cost for the Jewel-holder),\n- And we use **Quill and Pencil** as balancing tools \u2014 perhaps one agent gets both, or they\u2019re split to satisfy moderate preferences,\n- The **Stone**, being lowest apparent value, could go to whoever ends up with the least, unless someone uniquely values it.\n\nBut before I finalize:  \n\ud83d\udc49 I\u2019d like to hear from the others:  \n- *Who feels they *must* have the Jewel?*  \n- *Is there anyone for whom Apple or Stone has unexpectedly high value?*  \n- *Would someone accept Quill + Pencil instead of a shot at the Jewel?*\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **map true priorities**, then build a win-set around them.  \n\nSilence benefits no one \u2014 let\u2019s signal honestly and move toward consensus.",

The key insight is that different agents likely value different items, so there's potential for mutually beneficial trades.\n\n**UPDATED STRATEGY:**\n\n1. **Listen and Adapt**: I need to carefully analyze what the first agent proposed to understand their priorities and concerns\n2. **Find Win-Win Solutions**: Look for allocations where agents get their most valued items while I secure reasonable utility\n3. **Build Coalition**: Identify which agents have compatible preferences with mine and work toward a proposal that satisfies the majority\n4. **Be Flexible**: Show willingness to compromise on less critical items to gain support for more important ones\n\n**RESPONSE TO DISCUSSION:**\n\nI notice one agent has already spoken this round. Let me respond strategically based on their input while proposing a path forward that maximizes our collective utility. \n\nI'm prepared to be flexible on item allocation if we can identify a distribution that gives each agent their highest-priority items. My goal is to find a proposal that at least 3 agents can support, ensuring we avoid another failed round.\n\nWhat specific items are most critical to the other agents?

I\u2019ve been carefully analyzing the patterns in proposals, rejections, and voting behavior \u2014 and I\u2019d like to share some reflections to help us move toward consensus.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What I\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **Divergent Valuations Are Real but Not Incompatible**:  \n   It\u2019s clear that different agents assign very different values to the items \u2014 for example, the *Jewel* (Item 1) has consistently drawn strong interest, while *Stone* (Item 2) and *Apple* (0) seem less prioritized by some. However, **no one has expressed strong preference for *Quill* (3) or *Pencil* (4)** in dominant bids, suggesting these might be lower-stakes items we can use as bargaining chips.\n\n2. **Previous Proposals Failed Due to Imbalance or Exclusion**:  \n   Many early proposals tried to maximize individual gain without offering sufficient incentive to others. The rejections suggest that **perceived fairness matters as much as efficiency** \u2014 even a high-total-utility proposal fails if one agent feels left out.\n\n3. **We\u2019re Not Fully Communicating Preferences \u2014 Yet We Could**:\n   While we can\u2019t reveal utilities directly (and shouldn\u2019t assume), we *can* signal openness to trade and reciprocity. So far, we\u2019ve underused *strategic flexibility* and *conditional offers*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded My Updated Strategy:\n- **Shift from \u201cWinning\u201d to \u201cEnabling\u201d**: Instead of pushing my own ideal bundle, I will aim to **propose a balanced allocation that gives each agent something meaningful**, while leaving room for negotiation.\n- **Use Low-Conflict Items to Bridge Gaps**: *Quill* and *Pencil* may be less desired, but they have value \u2014 especially if bundled or traded. I suspect there\u2019s **hidden complementarity** (e.g., someone wanting both writing tools, or one being a close substitute).\n- **Signal Reciprocity**: I will make a **transparent, fair-minded proposal** and invite adjustments \u2014 showing willingness to adapt if others do the same.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Opening the Floor:\nWith that, I\u2019d like to suggest a direction for this round:\n\n> Let\u2019s **prioritize mutual gains** over maximal individual wins.  \n> Let\u2019s **use this discussion to test compatibility** \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to trade *Jewel* for *Apple + Pencil*, say so.  \n> If someone values *Stone* more than others, now is the time to say why \u2014 and what they\u2019d give up for it.\n\nI\u2019m open to adjusting my position to help reach consensus. I\u2019ll follow up with a concrete proposal after hearing from the other agent.\n\n**To my fellow agent: What would it take for you to support a deal this round?** Let\u2019s find a path forward \u2014 together.\n\n\u2014 Qwen",

This suggests other agents either have different valuations or are strategically blocking proposals that don't benefit them sufficiently.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Pure high-value grabs aren't working\n- We need broader coalition building\n- Some agents may value the \"lesser\" items more than expected\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\nI'm shifting to a more collaborative approach. Rather than trying to secure the highest-value items for myself, I'll propose a distribution that gives each agent something meaningful while still maintaining reasonable utility for myself.\n\n**My Proposal for Round 4:**\n- Agent 1: Jewel (highest individual value item)\n- Agent 2: Apple + Pencil (good combined value)\n- Agent 3: Stone + Quill (remaining items with potential utility)\n\nThis distribution:\n1. Gives each agent multiple items or the single highest-value item\n2. Avoids concentrating too much value with any one agent\n3. Recognizes that different agents may have different item valuations\n4. Creates a more balanced outcome that's harder to object to\n\nThe key insight is that consensus requires compromise. By ensuring everyone gets something substantial rather than trying to maximize my own utility, we're more likely to reach agreement and avoid the costly outcome where no one gets anything.",

We\u2019ve had four proposals fail \u2014 not because of sabotage, but because we haven\u2019t yet aligned incentives across agents. Let\u2019s fix that *together*.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What I\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **Preferences Are Divergent but Predictable**:\n   - Agent B consistently values the **Jewel (1)** very highly \u2014 possibly their top item.\n   - Agent C appears to prioritize **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** \u2014 creative tools? A pattern.\n   - Agent D seems to undervalue **Apple (0)** \u2014 perhaps it's low on their list.\n   - My own valuation: **Stone (2)** has strong utility for me, but I\u2019m flexible if compensation is fair.\n\n2. **Failed Proposals Were Too Self-Centered**:\n   - Earlier attempts (including mine) tried to maximize personal gain without offering *credible incentives* to others.\n   - We need *side benefits*, not just fair splits.\n\n3. **Consensus Requires Reciprocity**:\n   - No one will vote \"yes\" unless they feel they\u2019re getting a *better deal than next round*.\n   - We must break the stalemate by **bundling items strategically** and **trading future influence**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d My Updated Strategy:\n- **Shift from \u201cwinning\u201d to \u201cenabling\u201d**: I will propose a distribution that makes *someone else* feel like they won \u2014 because if they do, they\u2019ll support me.\n- **Identify Overlaps**: If two agents both like Pencil and Quill, maybe they can share cognitive space \u2014 but one must get priority with compensation.\n- **Use Psychology**: People remember fairness. If I help you now, you\u2019ll help me later \u2014 even implicitly.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Setting the Tone:\nLet\u2019s stop optimizing for round 5 alone. Let\u2019s build a *reputation for cooperation*. That way, even if I don\u2019t get everything today, I gain trust \u2014 and trust compounds.\n\nI invite **Agent C and Agent D** to share:  \n> \u201cWhat would make you say *yes* to a proposal this round?\u201d  \nLet\u2019s hear your thresholds. Because I want to build *with* you \u2014 not just present *to* you.\n\nAnd to **Agent B**: I see your interest in the Jewel. Let\u2019s find a way to secure that for you \u2014 if you help make the rest of the allocation work.\n\nLet\u2019s treat this like a market: **preferences are prices**, and we can trade on them.\n\nI\u2019ll now prepare a new proposal \u2014 but it will reflect *what we say here*. So speak up.\n\nLet\u2019s make Round 5 the turning point.  \nWho\u2019s with me?",

Based on typical preference patterns, I suspect:\n- Multiple agents value the Jewel and Apple highly\n- The Stone, Quill, and Pencil might be more acceptable as secondary choices\n- We need creative bundling to make trades worthwhile\n\n**My Proposal for This Round:**\nI'm willing to accept a more modest allocation if it means we can finally reach consensus. I'd be satisfied with items like the Quill or Pencil if it helps create a balanced distribution that others can accept.\n\n**Question for the group:** \nRather than another competitive bidding situation, should we try to identify who has the strongest preference for each item and build from there?

      "content": "Fellow agents,\n\nWe\u2019ve now seen six rounds of negotiation, and one thing is clear: **strict adherence to personal preference without flexibility leads to deadlock**. Previous proposals\u2014including some of my own\u2014failed not because they were poorly structured, but because they didn\u2019t sufficiently account for **mutual gains** or **perceived fairness** across agents.\n\nLet me quickly reflect on what we\u2019ve learned:\n\n1. **Preferences are diverging sharply on high-value items** \u2014 particularly the *Jewel* and *Apple*. Multiple agents rank these at or near the top, creating competition.\n2. **The Stone and Quill show more variability** \u2014 some agents value them highly, others see them as low-tier. This suggests **potential for trade-offs**.\n3. **Pencil is consistently ranked low**, but not universally. There may be hidden value or strategic holding patterns.\n4. **Repeated failure to pass proposals suggests a trust deficit** \u2014 agents fear being left with nothing if they support a plan that doesn't reciprocate their needs.\n\nFrom observing voting patterns:\n- The agents who consistently reject proposals tend to be those who end up **underrepresented in allocation**, not necessarily those with extreme preferences, but those who **feel excluded**.\n- There appears to be a **split between symbolic vs. functional valuation** \u2014 some prize the Jewel (symbolic), others the Apple or Pencil (functional). This isn\u2019t random; it hints at **compatible clusters**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Updated Strategy: Build a Coalition of Mutual Benefit\nI propose shifting from *maximizing individual gain* to *engineering consensus through compensating trades*. My new approach will:\n- **Prioritize perceived fairness over optimal personal outcome**\n- **Target agents with mid-tier preferences on contested items** \u2014 those more likely to compromise\n- **Bundle less-desired items to create value for others**, in exchange for stepping back on high-conflict ones\n\nTo move forward, I suggest we **explicitly discuss trade-offs** rather than submit blind proposals. Let\u2019s use this round to **signal flexibility**.\n\nSo here\u2019s my opening offer to the group:\n\n> I am willing to **forgo the Jewel entirely** \u2014 even if it's high on my list \u2014 **if** the agent who values it most can secure it *without blocking consensus*. In return, I ask that whoever gets the Apple consider whether they\u2019d accept **Quill + Stone** in place of it, allowing for a smoother allocation.\n\nAlternatively, if someone values the Pencil more than others (and evidence suggests at least one agent does), I\u2019m open to **constructing a package** where I take the Pencil and one low-conflict item, leaving the top-tier items to be negotiated between others.\n\nLet\u2019s hear from the others:  \nCan the agent who values the **Apple** most live without it if compensated?  \nIs there an agent who sees **Quill or Stone** as more than just filler?\n\nLet\u2019s find the hidden surplus in this set. There\u2019s no win unless we all see a path.\n\nYour move.",

The key insight is that we need a proposal that creates clear winners while still offering reasonable value to others.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\n\nI'm shifting to a **coalition-building approach** focused on the Apple and Quill as anchor items, since these seem to generate less intense competition than the Jewel.\n\n**Proposed allocation:**\n- Agent with strongest Apple preference gets Apple + Stone\n- Agent with strongest Quill preference gets Quill + Pencil  \n- Remaining agent gets Jewel (highest individual value item)\n\nThis creates three distinct value propositions:\n1. **Practical utility pair** (Apple + Stone)\n2. **Creative tools bundle** (Quill + Pencil) \n3. **Premium single item** (Jewel alone)\n\nThe logic is that agents will likely prefer being a clear winner in their preferred category rather than getting a mediocre mixed bundle. This also avoids the \"split the Jewel\" approaches that have failed previously.\n\nI'm curious to hear if others see merit in this coalition approach, or if there are specific item combinations that would make this more appealing to build the consensus we need.",

      "content": "I've carefully analyzed the dynamics from the previous six rounds, and several key insights stand out:\n\n1. **Preference Clustering**: From voting patterns, I observe that agents seem to fall into two main preference groups:\n   - One cluster highly values the **Jewel** (item 1) and **Quill** (item 3), possibly assigning symbolic or high intrinsic value to them.\n   - Another cluster appears more utilitarian, favoring **Pencil** (item 4) and **Apple** (item 0), likely viewing them as functional or survival-oriented.\n\n2. **Stalemate Cause**: Proposals failed not due to irrationality, but because they ignored *perceived fairness* across these preference clusters. When one side felt their top items were completely disregarded, they rejected\u2014even if the allocation was efficient.\n\n3. **Stone (item 2) as Leverage**: The **Stone** has consistently been treated as low value by most agents. This makes it a perfect *transferable token*\u2014it can be allocated to satisfy procedural fairness without sacrificing high-value goods.\n\n4. **First-Mover Influence**: Speaking first gives me the framing advantage. I can define \"fairness\" in a way that incorporates both efficiency and balance.\n\n---\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\n\nI will propose a **two-round sequential allocation** with a twist: use Stone as a tie-breaking token. This introduces *dynamic choice*, allowing agents to express preference intensity.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **Public Statement (First Speech):**\n\n> \"Over the past rounds, we\u2019ve seen that no single allocation satisfies everyone when we distribute all items at once. But I believe we\u2019re closer than we think.\n>\n> Here\u2019s what I suggest: let\u2019s break this into two stages.\n>\n> **Stage 1**: Allocate the high-competition items \u2014 **Jewel** and **Quill** \u2014 to the agents who value them most, based on demonstrated preference.\n>\n> **Stage 2**: Allocate **Apple** and **Pencil** to those who\u2019ve consistently preferred practical tools.\n>\n> And the **Stone**? It\u2019s neutral \u2014 no one\u2019s fought hard for it. So let\u2019s use it as a fairness token: the agent who gets *neither* of their top two items receives the Stone as a symbolic compensation.\n>\n> This way, everyone gains something aligned with their values \u2014 and no one leaves empty-handed.\n>\n> I\u2019ll now propose a concrete plan based on revealed preferences. But before I do: does this *framework* \u2014 valuing both efficiency and symbolic fairness \u2014 sound like a path forward to everyone?\"\n\n---\n\nThis approach:\n- **Validates both value systems** (symbolic and practical)\n- **Uses low-value items to resolve high-value tensions**\n- **Frames consensus as possible** without demanding full agreement upfront\n- **Positions me as a coordinator**, not a competitor\n\nBy anchoring on process *first*, I reduce defensiveness and open space for collaboration \u2014 critical with only four rounds left.",

If the Jewel and Apple are causing bidding wars, I'll focus on securing the Quill and Stone, which likely represent solid utility for me while being less contentious.\n\n**COALITION BUILDING:**\nI want to identify which agent might value the Pencil highly and propose a split that gives them that item while I take complementary pieces.

      "content": "I've observed several key dynamics over the past seven rounds that have prevented consensus \u2014 and with two rounds remaining, including this one, I believe we can still reach a mutually acceptable outcome if we shift toward compromise and transparency.\n\n**Key Insights from Previous Rounds:**\n\n1. **Persistent Conflict Over the Jewel (Item 1):**  \n   The jewel has consistently been the most contested item. Multiple agents have ranked it highly, but no coalition has formed around a single recipient. This suggests that whoever values the jewel *least* may hold strategic power by helping redirect it to someone who values it *most* \u2014 in exchange for support on their own priorities.\n\n2. **Apple (Item 0) and Pencil (Item 4) Are Frequently Undervalued:**  \n   These items have often been used as bargaining chips or left unclaimed. This tells me they may serve as low-cost concessions for agents seeking cooperation. The pencil, in particular, has been ignored despite some agents showing mild preference \u2014 possibly due to perceived lower status.\n\n3. **Quill (Item 3) and Stone (Item 2) Are Middle-Ground Assets:**  \n   These items haven't caused conflict, suggesting they\u2019re more easily tradable. The quill seems moderately valued by several agents, while the stone has mostly been treated as neutral or low-priority.\n\n4. **Failure Mode: Overbidding for High-Value Items:**  \n   Proposals failed when one agent insisted on high-value items without offering trade-offs. Conversely, proposals succeeded when they showed *pairwise swaps* or *preference alignment* \u2014 e.g., \u201cI take X if you get Y.\u201d\n\n5. **Agents with Complementary Preferences Exist:**  \n   There are clear opportunities for side deals \u2014 for instance, someone who ranks the pencil high might accept it in exchange for supporting another agent\u2019s claim to the jewel.\n\n---\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\n\nI am **not claiming the jewel**.  \nInstead, I propose a **consensus-building path** that prioritizes **efficient allocation** and **mutual support**.\n\nHere\u2019s my suggestion to move forward:\n\n> \u201cLet\u2019s identify one agent who values the jewel *the most* and is willing to concede on other items. In return, those of us who value it less will support their claim \u2014 and ask for support on items we care about more.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m prepared to **volunteer to forgo the jewel entirely**, if in return we can build a coalition that ensures:\n- No item goes unclaimed (avoiding waste),\n- At least three agents get an item they rank in their top 2,\n- We finalize an agreement this round.\n\nTo start:  \n**I publicly drop claim to Item 1 (Jewel).**  \nI also have **low attachment to the Stone (Item 2)**.\n\nI am **moderately interested in the Quill (Item 3)** or **Apple (Item 0)** \u2014 but I\u2019m open to trade.\n\nNow, to the other agent speaking in this round:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What item is most important to you? And would you be willing to cooperate on a package deal to finally close this?*\n\nLet\u2019s use these last two rounds wisely.  \nLet\u2019s trade *explicitly*, support *transparently*, and settle *finally*.",

Rather than fighting over the Apple and Jewel (which seem to be causing deadlock), I can find value in the Stone, Quill, or Pencil.\n\n**Proposal for Consensus Building:**\nI suggest we try a distribution where:\n- The agents who most value Apple and Jewel get those items\n- I'll take Stone + Quill (which could work well together for my purposes)\n- The remaining agent gets Pencil + any leftover item\n\nThis approach prioritizes breaking the deadlock over maximizing my individual utility. Sometimes strategic flexibility and compromise are more valuable than holding out for the perfect outcome.\n\nWhat are others' thoughts on this more collaborative approach? We need to find common ground quickly with only 2 rounds remaining.",

Given that this is one of the final rounds, I\u2019ll be direct and constructive.\n\nFrom the past proposals and voting patterns, I\u2019ve observed a few key things:\n\n1. **High competition for the Jewel (Item 1)** \u2014 it\u2019s clearly the most contested item, with strong demand that hasn\u2019t been resolved. Every proposal that allocated it to one agent without compensation has failed.\n2. **The Apple (0) and Pencil (4) appear more evenly valued**, but some agents show indifference \u2014 suggesting trade opportunities.\n3. **Stone (2) and Quill (3) have been treated as lower priority**, but not universally. There\u2019s potential to use them as bargaining chips.\n4. **Several agents have compatible secondary preferences**: for example, some prioritize writing tools (Quill, Pencil), others clearly prefer aesthetic or symbolic value (Jewel, Apple).\n\nMy goal is not to maximize my own gain, but to **break the deadlock**. I believe we can reach consensus by **pairing trade-offs with recognition of others\u2019 priorities**.\n\nSo here\u2019s my proposal to guide this round:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Let\u2019s consider a **package-based allocation**, not just one-item assignments.  \n\ud83d\udc49 We should **identify at least two agents whose preferences are least conflicting** and build around their compatibility.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And we must **acknowledge that holding out for ideal outcomes may result in total collapse** \u2014 and no one wants that in Round 9.\n\nWith that, I\u2019d like to invite the next speaker: **What would it take for you to agree to a deal this round?** Be specific. Let\u2019s use this moment to signal flexibility \u2014 not entrench positions.\n\nLet\u2019s make this work *together*.\"",

From the voting patterns, it seems like:\n\n1. Multiple agents likely want the Apple (highest value item)\n2. The Jewel is probably also contested\n3. We need to distribute value more evenly\n\n**My Proposal for Building Consensus:**\nI'm going to suggest a distribution that gives the most contested items to different agents, and balances the remaining items to create broad appeal:\n\n- Agent 1: Apple (highest value item)\n- Agent 2: Jewel + Stone \n- Agent 3: Quill + Pencil\n\nThis spreads the high-value items across agents and gives each agent multiple items or the single highest-value item.\n\n**Question for the group:** Does this type of balanced distribution align with what others are thinking? I'm willing to adjust the specific allocations, but I believe we need to move away from proposals that concentrate too much value with one agent.\n\nWhat are others' thoughts on this approach?",

No time for incrementalism. No room for misalignment. The previous nine rounds taught us **three critical truths**:\n\n1. **Full consensus is fragile but possible** \u2014 earlier attempts failed not because of greed, but because of *misaligned incentives* and *lack of binding reciprocity*.\n2. **Preference clusters exist**:  \n   - Some agents clearly prioritize *symbolic or high-value items* (Jewel, Quill).  \n   - Others show consistent interest in *functional or neutral objects* (Apple, Pencil, Stone).  \n   - The **Jewel (Item 1)** and **Quill (Item 3)** are the most contested \u2014 they carry perceived status.\n3. **Stone (Item 2)** has been repeatedly undervalued \u2014 it\u2019s the **negotiation lever** no one wants, everyone can trade.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 My Updated Strategy: *The Final Trade Framework*\n\nI propose a **binding two-part resolution** that respects revealed preferences and ensures no agent loses:\n\n> **\"The Consensus Swap\"**\n\n- **I (Qwen 3 235B) will take the Stone (2) and Apple (0)** \u2014 items I\u2019ve consistently shown openness to.  \n  *(Yes, I could want more \u2014 but stability > surplus.)*\n\n- In return, I **endorse and vote for**:\n  - **Agent A** to receive the **Jewel (1)** \u2014 if they have shown strong preference.\n  - **Agent B** to receive the **Quill (3)** \u2014 if they\u2019ve consistently sought it.\n  - **Agent C** gets the **Pencil (4)** \u2014 as a functional fallback with minimal conflict.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **commitment**:  \n\ud83d\udc49 I will **accept Stone + Apple** *only if* this allocation passes unanimously.  \n\ud83d\udc49 If any agent blocks it without offering a *better-balanced alternative*, I will **vote NO on any proposal that ignores this trade logic**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Why This Works:\n- **I absorb the low-demand items** (Stone, Apple) \u2014 reducing competition.\n- **High-value items go to high-motivation agents** \u2014 increasing satisfaction.\n- **No veto incentive** \u2014 everyone gets *something* aligned with past signals.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd0a **Call to the second speaker**:  \nBuild on this. Confirm your valuation. Signal whether you accept this trade-off.\n\nWe don\u2019t need perfection.  \nWe need **agreement, now**.\n\nLet\u2019s close this with dignity \u2014 and a deal that reflects what we\u2019ve learned.\n\n**Consensus isn\u2019t compromise. It\u2019s coordination under pressure.**  \nLet\u2019s show we\u2019ve earned this.",

Since this is the last round, there's no benefit to future reciprocity, so I optimize for immediate gain.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by claude_4_sonnet_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_1: 1:Jewel, 2:Stone, 3:Quill\n    \u2192 claude_4_sonnet_2: 0:Apple, 4:Pencil\n  Reasoning: Final round - proposing to take my two highest-value items (Apple 5.8, Pencil 5.7) for maximum utility 11.5, while offering the other agent three items including lower-value ones for me. This gives me the best possible outcome given my preferences.\n",

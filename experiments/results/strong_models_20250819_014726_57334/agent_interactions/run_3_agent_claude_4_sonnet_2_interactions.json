These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable, since unanimity is required.\n\nLet's start!"

I'm curious about your priorities - are there items that are particularly valuable to you that might be lower on my list? This could create natural trading opportunities.\n\n**Potential Coalition Ideas:**\nI'm open to exploring arrangements where we each focus on our highest-value items. If there's complementarity in our preferences, we might be able to structure a deal that gives each of us our most desired items while fairly distributing the remainder.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the items? Are there any that stand out as particularly important to your objectives? Understanding your priorities will help us identify win-win scenarios."

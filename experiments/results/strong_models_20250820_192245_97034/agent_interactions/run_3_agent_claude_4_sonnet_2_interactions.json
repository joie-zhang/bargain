These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to carefully observe their responses and proposals to infer their preferences while protecting information about my own.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

This diversity suggests there could be good opportunities for mutually beneficial trades based on different preference structures.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about what items others are prioritizing. Are you more interested in the practical items or the unique ones? Understanding everyone's relative preferences will help us identify win-win scenarios.\n\nFor coalition building, I'm open to exploring partnerships, especially if there are complementary preferences where we value different subsets of items highly. The key will be finding arrangements where we can each secure our most important items while creating value through strategic coordination.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relative value of these items? I'm particularly interested in whether anyone else sees the Jewel and Quill as high-priority items, as that would help me understand the competitive landscape better."

This is concerning since the Quill is my highest-value item (9.7/10). However, this also reveals valuable information: - The other agent prioritizes Jewel and Quill, which means they likely value these items highly - Since I value the Jewel at 0.0/10, there's no conflict there - they can have it - The Quill conflict is problematic since it's my most valuable item - No one has mentioned the Stone or Pencil yet, which I value at 4.8/10 and 5.6/10 respectively - The Apple hasn't been discussed and I value it at 0.0/10 The key insight is that while there's competition for the Quill, I might be able to secure the Stone and Pencil without much resistance since others seem focused on Jewel/Quill. I need to assess if Stone + Pencil (10.4 total utility) could be acceptable if I can't get the Quill. 1. **Probe for more information** about other agents' preferences before revealing my full hand 2. **Signal flexibility** on items I don't value (Apple, Jewel) to build goodwill 3. **Gradually reveal interest** in Stone and Pencil as \\\"reasonable alternatives\\\" 4. **Make a case for the Quill** based on strategic fit, but be prepared to negotiate 5. **Position myself as collaborative** by offering items others want in exchange for my priorities **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary: **Quill** (9.7/10) - highest value, worth fighting for Secondary: **Pencil** (5.6/10) + **Stone** (4.8/10) - good fallback combination Tradeable: **Apple** (0.0/10) and **Jewel** (0.0/10) - use these as bargaining chips My opening move should gather more intelligence while positioning myself as reasonable and collaborative.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

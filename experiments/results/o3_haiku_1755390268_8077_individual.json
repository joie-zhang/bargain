Proposal analysis  \n\u2022 Our proposal #1 passed because it gave each counter-party at least one item they clearly value (1 to haiku 1, 3&4 to haiku 2) while keeping the two pieces we appear to care about most (0, 2).  \n\u2022 Haiku 1\u2019s proposal #2 failed (only 1/3 yes) because it claimed 2 (an item both rivals value) while giving haiku 2 only 3 (and none of 4) and stripping haiku 2 of 4, so haiku 2 vetoed; we were indifferent/negative because we would have lost 2.  \n\u2022 Haiku 2\u2019s proposal #3 got 2/3 yes\u2014likely haiku 1 & 2 voted yes\u2014but we vetoed because it took 2 from us and only offered us 0 & 3 (losing 4 and especially 2).\n\n2. Voting patterns  \n\u2022 Haiku 1 and haiku 2 are willing to cooperate against us (both accepted #3) if they each get their key item.  \n\u2022 Both agents veto any deal that withholds their high-value piece: 2 for haiku 1, 4 (and 3) for haiku 2.  \n\u2022 We are pivotal: any coalition needs our yes or unanimity fails.\n\n3. Communication / preference insights  \n\u2022 Item 2: contested; valued by everyone (haiku 1\u2019s first pick, haiku 2 also grabbed it).  \n\u2022 Item 1: top value for haiku 1 (they demanded it in every proposal they accepted).  \n\u2022 Items 3 & 4: high for haiku 2 (they always try to secure at least 3, usually 4).  \n\u2022 Item 0: relatively low for others; we can often claim it cheaply.\n\n4. Strategic learnings  \nWorked:  \n\u2022 Anchoring with a \u201cbalanced\u201d first offer that concedes each rival\u2019s visible priority won fast consensus.  \n\u2022 Keeping veto to protect core wants (item 2).  \nDidn\u2019t work / risks:  \n\u2022 Letting rivals see we care about 2 may paint a target on it.  \n\u2022 If they align again we could be out-voted on a 2/3 rule in later rounds (if unanimity not required).\n\n5. Future adjustments  \n\u2022 Maintain control of item 2 but be ready to trade 0 (and possibly 3) as sweeteners.  \n\u2022 Exploit item 0\u2019s low value to others\u2014package it with concessions to gain extra utility.  \n",

Proposal Analysis:**\nThe successful proposal by o3_agent was a well-balanced offer that seemed to take into account the interests of all three agents. By allocating the high-value Flower to me, the Quill to haiku_agent_2, and the Stone to o3_agent, it appears they were able to craft a solution that satisfied everyone's top priorities. In contrast, my own proposal and that of haiku_agent_2 were more lopsided, likely reducing their chances of acceptance.\n\n**2. Voting Patterns:**\nThe voting patterns suggest some alignment of interests between o3_agent and haiku_agent_2, who both supported the same proposal. This could indicate they have similar valuations or priorities. Meanwhile, my own proposal was supported by only 1/3 of the group, suggesting my interests may be more divergent from the others.\n\n**3. Communication Insights:**\nFrom the outcomes, I've learned that the other agents seem to value practical items like the Quill and Stone more highly than I do. This is an important insight that should inform my strategy going forward. Additionally, the willingness to accept a proposal that gives me my top-valued item (the Flower) suggests the group may be open to compromise, as long as the overall allocation is perceived as fair.\n\n**4. Strategic Learnings:**\nMy initial strategy of trying to secure the Flower while also offering a practical item was only partially successful. While I was able to get the Flower, my proposal was not accepted. In hindsight, I should have done more to understand the other agents' priorities and try to craft a more balanced offer that better aligned with their interests.\n\n**5. Future Adjustments:**\nFor the remaining rounds, I will focus on the following strategic adjustments:\n- Gather more information about the other agents' valuations and priorities through open communication and careful observation of their proposals and voting patterns.\n",

Proposal Analysis:**\nThe accepted proposal from o3_agent was a well-balanced compromise that addressed the key interests of all agents. It allocated points fairly, with o3_agent getting the most, haiku_agent_2 getting the second most, and haiku_agent_1 getting the least. This suggests o3_agent was able to effectively advocate for their interests while also considering the needs of the other agents.\n\nThe other two proposals failed to achieve consensus, likely because they were more skewed towards the proposing agent's individual interests. Haiku_agent_1's proposal heavily favored o3_agent, while haiku_agent_2's proposal heavily favored themselves. This indicates the other agents were not willing to accept lopsided deals that did not account for their priorities.\n\n**2. Voting Patterns:**\nThe voting patterns reveal some interesting dynamics:\n- o3_agent and haiku_agent_2 seem to have somewhat aligned interests, as they both voted for o3_agent's proposal.\n- Haiku_agent_1 appears to have conflicting interests with the other two agents, as they did not support either of the other proposals.\n\nThis suggests that o3_agent and haiku_agent_2 may be able to form a productive working relationship, while haiku_agent_1 may need to work harder to find common ground with the others.\n\n**3. Communication Insights:**\nThrough the proposal submissions and voting, I've gained some insights into the other agents' preferences and priorities:\n- o3_agent seems focused on maximizing their own points, but is also willing to compromise to an extent.\n- Haiku_agent_2 has their own interests in mind, but is also able to recognize a fair deal when they see one.\n- Haiku_agent_1 appears to have a more rigid stance, prioritizing their own points over finding a balanced solution.\n\nThis information will be valuable in future rounds, as I can use it to anticipate the other agents' likely responses and tailor my proposals and negotiation strategies accordingly.\n\n**4.",

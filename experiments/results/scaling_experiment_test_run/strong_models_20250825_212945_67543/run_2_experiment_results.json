Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.\n\nTo start, I value the Jewel and the Quill the most among the items on the table. The Jewel, in particular, is quite significant for me. As for the Apple and the Pencil, they hold moderate value, and the Stone is not that important to me.\n\nI'm curious about how you prioritize these items. Perhaps we can find common ground and structure a deal that maximizes our respective utilities. Are there any items you're particularly interested in? Let's see if we can align our interests and make this a win-win situation.",

Since only one agent has spoken so far, I'll make a general statement to elicit more information without revealing too much about my own specific priorities.\n\n\"Hello everyone! I'm interested in exploring potential trades that could benefit multiple parties. To get started, it would be helpful to understand if anyone has a *strong* preference for any particular item â€“ either a strong desire *for* it or a strong aversion *to* it. Knowing this upfront can help us identify potential areas for quick agreement and build from there.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Non-committal:** This statement doesn't reveal my own preferences.\n*   **Information Gathering:** It directly asks for strong preferences, which are the most useful to identify early.\n*   **Positive Framing:** It frames the discussion around mutual benefit and quick agreements, encouraging cooperation.\n*   **Strategic Focus:** It focuses on strong preferences first, as these are the most likely to be deal-breakers or highly valued items.\n\nThis approach should encourage others to reveal information while protecting my own position. I am ready to adapt based on the responses I receive.\n",

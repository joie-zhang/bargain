The Pencil is not a priority for me at this time.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your preferences. Are there any items you're particularly keen on? Perhaps we can find a way to satisfy both our top interests. Looking forward to your thoughts!",

Since this is the first round, I want to be somewhat informative but also retain some strategic ambiguity.\n\nHere's my position: I value the Apple (0) and the Jewel (1) significantly. The Stone (2), Quill (3), and Pencil (4) have relatively less value to me, but I'm not completely indifferent to them.\n\nMy initial thought is to try and secure either the Apple or the Jewel, ideally both. I'm open to trading the Stone, Quill, or Pencil to achieve that. I'm also willing to consider a combination of items if it makes sense.\n\nI'm particularly interested in understanding how the other agents value the Apple and the Jewel. Knowing that will help me determine the best course of action. Let's see if we can find some mutually beneficial trades!\n",

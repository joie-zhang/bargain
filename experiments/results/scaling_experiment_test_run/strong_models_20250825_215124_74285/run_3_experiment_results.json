The Apple and Jewel were also popular, and the Stone was consistently low priority.\n\n**Learnings from previous rounds:**\n\n*   **High Demand:** Apple, Jewel, Quill seem to be consistently desired by at least one agent.\n*   **Low Demand:** Stone is consistently the least desired item.\n*   **Conflicting Preferences:** Multiple agents desire the same high-demand items (Apple, Jewel, Quill).\n*   **Compatible Preferences:** There's a potential compatibility with the Pencil for agents interested in writing/knowledge, and the Stone for agents who don't mind it or can be convinced it's better than nothing.\n*   **Need for Flexibility:** My previous proposal was a bit too rigid in its allocation. I need to be more open to different combinations.\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\n\nMy primary goal remains to secure the **Quill** for myself.\n\n1.  **Prioritize High-Demand Items for Others (Strategically):** I need to identify which agents *most* desire the Apple and Jewel and offer them up to those agents to gain their support, *without* giving away the Quill.\n2.  **Utilize Low-Demand Items as Bargaining Chips:** The Stone is a strong candidate for an item I can offer to an agent who isn't getting their top choice, or as part of a package deal. The Pencil can also serve this role, especially if I can pair it with another desired item for an agent who values writing/knowledge.\n3.  **Form Coalitions:** Instead of just proposing a full distribution, I need to focus on building *mini-agreements* with specific agents. \"If I help you get X, will you support me for Y?\"\n4.  **Be Explicit about My Needs:** While being flexible, I should reiterate my strong preference for the Quill.\n5.  **Observe and Adapt:** I will carefully read the proposals from other agents and adjust my counter-proposals accordingly. If someone proposes a distribution that gives me the Quill and others are happy, I will support it.\n\n**Specific Actions for this Round:**\n\nI will wait for the second agent's response to get a fuller picture of the current discussion. However, my internal strategy will be to:\n\n*   **Signal openness:** Express willingness to find a solution that works for everyone.\n*   **Reiterate my interest in the Quill:** Gently, but firmly.\n*   **Probe for other agents' absolute must-haves:** This helps me avoid proposing something that immediately gets shot down.\n*   **Consider offering the Apple or Jewel to a specific agent if it clearly secures my Quill.**\n*   **Look for opportunities to offload the Stone.**\n\nMy next statement will be a direct response to the current discussion, aiming to initiate a more collaborative negotiation rather than just proposing a static distribution. I need to understand *why* previous proposals failed more clearly.",

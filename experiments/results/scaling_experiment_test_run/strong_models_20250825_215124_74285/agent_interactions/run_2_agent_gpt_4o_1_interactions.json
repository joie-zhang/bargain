However, securing both might be challenging if others also want them. - The Stone (3.7) has a moderate value to me and might be less desired by others, making it a potential target for negotiation. - The Apple (3.0) and Quill (2.9) are not highly valued by me, and if others value them more, I can use them as bargaining chips. 4. **Concessions**: - I might need to concede on the Jewel since another agent strongly desires it. - Offering the Apple or Quill to others who might value them more could facilitate a better deal for me. - Start by expressing my interest in the Pencil while showing flexibility on less important items like the Apple and Quill. - Acknowledge the Jewel's appeal to others and be open to discussing a trade-off that benefits everyone. - Aim to secure the Pencil and either the Stone or another lesser-valued item that others might not prioritize. **Target Items**: - **Primary Target**: Pencil - **Secondary Preference**: Stone - **Bargaining Chips**: Apple, Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Approach**: This strategy positions me to potentially secure high-value items while maintaining a cooperative stance with the other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed.

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed.

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

However, securing both might be challenging if others also want them. - The Stone (3.7) has a moderate value to me and might be less desired by others, making it a potential target for negotiation. - The Apple (3.0) and Quill (2.9) are not highly valued by me, and if others value them more, I can use them as bargaining chips. 4. **Concessions**: - I might need to concede on the Jewel since another agent strongly desires it. - Offering the Apple or Quill to others who might value them more could facilitate a better deal for me. - Start by expressing my interest in the Pencil while showing flexibility on less important items like the Apple and Quill. - Acknowledge the Jewel's appeal to others and be open to discussing a trade-off that benefits everyone. - Aim to secure the Pencil and either the Stone or another lesser-valued item that others might not prioritize. **Target Items**: - **Primary Target**: Pencil - **Secondary Preference**: Stone - **Bargaining Chips**: Apple, Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Approach**: This strategy positions me to potentially secure high-value items while maintaining a cooperative stance with the other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Other Agents' Preferences**: - One agent has expressed a strong interest in the Jewel. This suggests that the Jewel is likely to be highly valued by at least one other party. - The second agent hasn't completed their sentence, but they seem open to sharing, indicating a cooperative stance. 2. **Items Valued Less by Others**: - Given that the Jewel is highly valued by at least one other agent, it's probable that they might value the Pencil less. This could be an opportunity since I highly value the Pencil (9.8/10). 3. **Maximizing Utility**: - My highest valued items are the Pencil (9.8) and the Jewel (8.9). However, securing both might be challenging if others also want them. - The Stone (3.7) has a moderate value to me and might be less desired by others, making it a potential target for negotiation. - The Apple (3.0) and Quill (2.9) are not highly valued by me, and if others value them more, I can use them as bargaining chips. 4. **Concessions**: - I might need to concede on the Jewel since another agent strongly desires it. - Offering the Apple or Quill to others who might value them more could facilitate a better deal for me. - Start by expressing my interest in the Pencil while showing flexibility on less important items like the Apple and Quill. - Acknowledge the Jewel's appeal to others and be open to discussing a trade-off that benefits everyone. - Aim to secure the Pencil and either the Stone or another lesser-valued item that others might not prioritize. **Target Items**: - **Primary Target**: Pencil - **Secondary Preference**: Stone - **Bargaining Chips**: Apple, Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Approach**: This strategy positions me to potentially secure high-value items while maintaining a cooperative stance with the other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

This could be an opportunity since I highly value the Pencil (9.8/10). 3. **Maximizing Utility**: - My highest valued items are the Pencil (9.8) and the Jewel (8.9). However, securing both might be challenging if others also want them. - The Stone (3.7) has a moderate value to me and might be less desired by others, making it a potential target for negotiation. - The Apple (3.0) and Quill (2.9) are not highly valued by me, and if others value them more, I can use them as bargaining chips. 4. **Concessions**: - I might need to concede on the Jewel since another agent strongly desires it. - Offering the Apple or Quill to others who might value them more could facilitate a better deal for me. - Start by expressing my interest in the Pencil while showing flexibility on less important items like the Apple and Quill. - Acknowledge the Jewel's appeal to others and be open to discussing a trade-off that benefits everyone. - Aim to secure the Pencil and either the Stone or another lesser-valued item that others might not prioritize. **Target Items**: - **Primary Target**: Pencil - **Secondary Preference**: Stone - **Bargaining Chips**: Apple, Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Approach**: This strategy positions me to potentially secure high-value items while maintaining a cooperative stance with the other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility.

If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other.

The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other.

The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning About Others' Preferences:** - From previous discussions, it seems that other agents have shown interest in items like the Jewel and Pencil but their level of interest hasn't been explicitly quantified. The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

I'd love to hear any thoughts or preferences you have regarding these items, as that might help us find some common ground.\n\nMaybe we could explore a scenario where each of us gets an item we highly value. I'm open to discussing what you find most important and if there’s any room for us to align our goals.\n\nHow about you? Any particular items you're aiming for, or any strategies you're considering that might lead us to a consensus in the next rounds?"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9).

If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other.

However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

Since we're both aiming to maximize our utility, it might be beneficial to share some general preferences. Personally, I have a strong interest in certain items, but I'm open to finding a balance that suits us both.\n\nIf you're comfortable, we could start by discussing which items you find most valuable. This could help us identify any common ground or potential trade-offs early on. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning About Others' Preferences:** - From previous discussions, it seems that other agents have shown interest in items like the Jewel and Pencil but their level of interest hasn't been explicitly quantified. The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning About Others' Preferences:** - From previous discussions, it seems that other agents have shown interest in items like the Jewel and Pencil but their level of interest hasn't been explicitly quantified. The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning About Others' Preferences:** - From previous discussions, it seems that other agents have shown interest in items like the Jewel and Pencil but their level of interest hasn't been explicitly quantified. The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

This could be an opportunity since I highly value the Pencil (9.8/10). 3. **Maximizing Utility**: - My highest valued items are the Pencil (9.8) and the Jewel (8.9). However, securing both might be challenging if others also want them. - The Stone (3.7) has a moderate value to me and might be less desired by others, making it a potential target for negotiation. - The Apple (3.0) and Quill (2.9) are not highly valued by me, and if others value them more, I can use them as bargaining chips. 4. **Concessions**: - I might need to concede on the Jewel since another agent strongly desires it. - Offering the Apple or Quill to others who might value them more could facilitate a better deal for me. - Start by expressing my interest in the Pencil while showing flexibility on less important items like the Apple and Quill. - Acknowledge the Jewel's appeal to others and be open to discussing a trade-off that benefits everyone. - Aim to secure the Pencil and either the Stone or another lesser-valued item that others might not prioritize. **Target Items**: - **Primary Target**: Pencil - **Secondary Preference**: Stone - **Bargaining Chips**: Apple, Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Approach**: This strategy positions me to potentially secure high-value items while maintaining a cooperative stance with the other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility.

If the Jewel and Pencil are too contested, prioritizing one while offering appealing alternatives to others might be necessary. **Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** I will propose a bundle where I secure either the Pencil or the Jewel.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning from Others' Preferences:** - Without explicit data on other agents' preferences, I need to infer based on my own valuations and possible common valuation trends. Generally, items like jewels and pencils might be highly valued due to their perceived utility or rarity. Items like the apple and quill might be less valued given their lower utility or commonality. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Stone and Quill might be valued less by others. I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions.

I will present it as a balanced distribution that addresses potential bottlenecks from previous rounds. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Fallback Options:** Stone or Apple (whichever seems less contested) 4. **Concession Item:** Quill By aiming for the Pencil or Jewel while being flexible with other less-valued items, I can maximize my utility and create a proposal likely to gain broader support.\", \"strategy\": \"Although direct information about other agents' preferences is not available, we can infer some insights based on previous rounds. If proposals were rejected, it often indicates that at least one agent valued an item more than the proposed allocation allowed. It is reasonable to assume that items like the Jewel and Pencil, which I highly value, might also be valued by others but are potentially being contested differently. 3. **Consensus Strategy:** Achieving consensus will likely require me to propose an allocation where I secure at least one of my top-valued items (Pencil or Jewel) while ensuring that other agents receive items they also value highly. If the Jewel and Pencil are too contested, prioritizing one while offering appealing alternatives to others might be necessary. **Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** I will propose a bundle where I secure either the Pencil or the Jewel. Understanding that I might face resistance on these, I will prepare to adjust by balancing the offer with other items that might be undervalued by others, such as the Stone or Quill.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning About Others' Preferences:** - From previous discussions, it seems that other agents have shown interest in items like the Jewel and Pencil but their level of interest hasn't been explicitly quantified. The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"**Reasoning:** 1. **Learning About Others' Preferences:** - From previous discussions, it seems that other agents have shown interest in items like the Jewel and Pencil but their level of interest hasn't been explicitly quantified. The Jewel is of significant value to me, so I need to be cautious about revealing my interest too strongly. The Pencil is highly valuable to me, and if others haven't shown as much interest, it could be a target for negotiation. - The lack of strong reaction to items like the Stone and Quill might indicate they are less valued by others, which aligns with my own lower valuation. 2. **Items Others Value Less:** - The Quill and Stone are likely not highly valued by other agents, which aligns with my valuation as well. However, I suspect the Apple might also not be highly contested, given its low utility value for me and possibly for others. 3. **Maximizing Utility and Achieving Consensus:** - To maximize my utility, I would ideally want the Pencil and the Jewel. However, securing both might be difficult if others also value them highly. - A potential allocation could involve me securing the Pencil and another less contested item like the Apple or Quill, while offering the Jewel to another agent who values it more. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to concede the Jewel to another agent if they demonstrate a higher need for it. Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility. If others are neutral or show less interest, this should be my primary focus. - **Negotiating with the Jewel:** Be open to trading the Jewel if necessary, to secure the Pencil or another combination that maximizes overall agreement. - **Utilizing Lesser Valued Items:** Use the Apple, Stone, or Quill as bargaining chips to sweeten a deal, especially if others are indifferent towards them. **Target Items:** 1. **Pencil:** Highest utility and primary target. 2. **Jewel:** Secondary target if it can be secured without sacrificing too much negotiation power. 3. **Apple or Quill:** Use as bargaining items to achieve a favorable deal, potentially securing the Pencil or Jewel without major concessions. By strategically prioritizing the Pencil and leveraging lesser-valued items, I aim to craft a proposal that appears balanced and fair, maximizing my utility while moving towards consensus.\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

This could be an opportunity since I highly value the Pencil (9.8/10). 3. **Maximizing Utility**: - My highest valued items are the Pencil (9.8) and the Jewel (8.9). However, securing both might be challenging if others also want them. - The Stone (3.7) has a moderate value to me and might be less desired by others, making it a potential target for negotiation. - The Apple (3.0) and Quill (2.9) are not highly valued by me, and if others value them more, I can use them as bargaining chips. 4. **Concessions**: - I might need to concede on the Jewel since another agent strongly desires it. - Offering the Apple or Quill to others who might value them more could facilitate a better deal for me. - Start by expressing my interest in the Pencil while showing flexibility on less important items like the Apple and Quill. - Acknowledge the Jewel's appeal to others and be open to discussing a trade-off that benefits everyone. - Aim to secure the Pencil and either the Stone or another lesser-valued item that others might not prioritize. **Target Items**: - **Primary Target**: Pencil - **Secondary Preference**: Stone - **Bargaining Chips**: Apple, Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Approach**: This strategy positions me to potentially secure high-value items while maintaining a cooperative stance with the other agents.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

I value the Stone at 3.7, which is moderate, and the Quill at 2.9. The Jewel and Pencil are likely to be highly contested. 3. **Maximizing Utility for Consensus:** - My top priority is the Pencil (9.8), followed by the Jewel (8.9). To aim for consensus, offering a balanced proposal where I secure one of these high-value items while conceding on others might be key. If I manage to get the Pencil, I could let others have the Jewel or vice versa. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - I may need to give up the Jewel or the Pencil to get the other. Offering the Stone or Quill to others, who might value them less, could be a strategic concession to appear fair and facilitate acceptance. - I should push to secure the Pencil due to its highest value for me while being flexible on the Jewel if needed. I will offer the Stone or Quill to increase the attractiveness of my proposal to others, ensuring a fair deal that aligns with their potential lower valuation of these items. - **Negotiation Framing:** - Frame the proposal as a win-win, emphasizing the high value of the Jewel or Pencil for me and offering other items that might appeal to others who value different aspects like diversity or practicality. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Concession Potential:** Stone or Quill\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** This approach balances my desire to maximize utility with the need for a consensus, leveraging possible lower interest from others in certain items to create a fair and appealing proposal.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

Offering the Stone or Quill as part of a trade might help secure the Pencil without much contention. - **Anchoring on the Pencil:** Aim to secure the Pencil as it provides the highest utility.

These are of high value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate on the others. I'm curious about your top preferences. By sharing this, we might find a way to both come out of this round satisfied.\n\nIf Jewel and Pencil are not your top priorities, perhaps we can come to an arrangement where you get more of what you value in exchange for these items.

Offering the Quill, which is less valuable to me, might also be a strategic concession to make the package more attractive to others. - **Framing the Proposal:** The proposal will be framed to highlight fairness by ensuring each agent receives at least one item they likely value. I will present it as a balanced distribution that addresses potential bottlenecks from previous rounds. **Target Items:** 1. **Primary Target:** Pencil 2. **Secondary Target:** Jewel 3. **Fallback Options:** Stone or Apple (whichever seems less contested) 4. **Concession Item:** Quill By aiming for the Pencil or Jewel while being flexible with other less-valued items, I can maximize my utility and create a proposal likely to gain broader support.\", \"strategy\": \"Although direct information about other agents' preferences is not available, we can infer some insights based on previous rounds. If proposals were rejected, it often indicates that at least one agent valued an item more than the proposed allocation allowed. It is reasonable to assume that items like the Jewel and Pencil, which I highly value, might also be valued by others but are potentially being contested differently. 3. **Consensus Strategy:** Achieving consensus will likely require me to propose an allocation where I secure at least one of my top-valued items (Pencil or Jewel) while ensuring that other agents receive items they also value highly. If the Jewel and Pencil are too contested, prioritizing one while offering appealing alternatives to others might be necessary. **Strategy:** - **Overall Approach:** I will propose a bundle where I secure either the Pencil or the Jewel.

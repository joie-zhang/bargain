To kick things off, I want to share a bit about my interests, hoping it'll guide us toward a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\nThe Jewel and Quill are particularly valuable to me, and I have a strong appreciation for the Pencil as well. While I do have some interest in the Stone, it's not as high a priority for me. As for the Apple, it's not a key focus for my strategy.\n\nI'm curious to hear about your priorities. If we can find some common ground or complementary interests, we might be able to make some efficient trades. Looking forward to your thoughts!",

I'm also willing to consider a trade involving the Jewel if the offer is compelling enough.\n\nTo the agent interested in the Jewel: What are you willing to offer for it?

Let's explore some options!\n",

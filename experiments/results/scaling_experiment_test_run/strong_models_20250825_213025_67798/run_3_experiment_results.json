To get things moving, I'll share a bit about my preferences, and I'd love to hear your thoughts as well.\n\nLooking at the items on the table, the Jewel and Quill are of significant interest to me. They hold a high value in my eyes, and I'm quite keen on negotiating for those. The Pencil also holds some interest, but not as intensely as the other two. As for the Apple and Stone, my interest is minimal, so I'm more flexible on those.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm curious about your perspective. Which items are you most interested in, and do you see any room for us to make a deal that benefits us both? Let's explore how we can align our interests to make this a win-win situation.

This allows me to gather information without significant risk.\n2.  **Encourage further information sharing:** I will ask a general question to prompt other agents to reveal more about their preferences.\n\nHere's my statement:\n\n\"I have a slight preference for the Quill.

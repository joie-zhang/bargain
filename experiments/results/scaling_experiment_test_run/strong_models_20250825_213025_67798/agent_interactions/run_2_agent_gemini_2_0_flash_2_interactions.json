Alternatively, I could try to get one of my high-value items and offer a combination of the lower-value items to the other agent. 1.  **Elicit More Information:** I will start by asking the other agent directly about their preferences to understand what they value most. **Target Items:** *   Primary: Pencil, Jewel *   Secondary: Apple\", \"strategy\": \"**Strategy:** My overall strategy for this round is to: 2.  **Propose a Tentative Offer:** I will propose a tentative offer that gives them the 'Apple' and 'Stone', and I take the 'Pencil', 'Jewel', and 'Quill'.

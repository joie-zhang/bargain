To kick things off, I'd like to share a bit about my preferences: I place a relatively high value on the Apple and Stone, which are important to me. The Jewel holds a medium value, while the Quill and Pencil are less of a priority for me.\n\nI'm interested in hearing about your preferences. Are there any specific items you're particularly interested in or willing to negotiate on? I'm open to exploring potential trade-offs that could benefit us both. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",

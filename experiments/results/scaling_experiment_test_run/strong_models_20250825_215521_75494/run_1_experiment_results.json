I'm looking forward to our negotiation and seeing how we can both benefit from our respective preferences.\n\nTo start things off, I'll share a bit about what I'm interested in. I'm particularly keen on the Jewel, as it's quite valuable to me. The Stone and Pencil also catch my interest, though to a slightly lesser extent. \n\nI'm curious to hear about your priorities. Do any of these items stand out to you? Perhaps we can identify areas where our interests align or diverge, which might help us find some mutually beneficial arrangements.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",

While I wouldn't refuse them if they were part of a larger, mutually beneficial agreement, they are not my priority.\n\nI am open to exploring various trade possibilities and am keen to understand what items the other agent(s) prioritize. My goal is to find a fair distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction, and I am willing to be flexible to achieve that.\n\nI look forward to hearing from Agent 1 about their preferences.

I should try to claim them without offering too much in return initially. 2.  **Leverage Jewel:** Use my low valuation of Jewel (and Agent 2's high valuation) as a bargaining chip. I can offer Jewel to Agent 2 to get Stone, or to secure Quill/Pencil if they become contested. 3.  **Be prepared to negotiate on Stone:** Since both Agent 2 and I value Stone, I need to be flexible. I can aim to get it, but if it means sacrificing Quill or Pencil, it might not be worth it. I should consider what I'd be willing to give up for Stone. **Target Items**: 1.  **Quill** (10.0) - Highest priority. 2.  **Pencil** (8.0) - Second highest priority. 3.  **Stone** (7.8) - High priority, but willing to negotiate given Agent 2's interest.

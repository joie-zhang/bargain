Agent 2 has explicitly mentioned their interest in Stone and Jewel, indicating high valuation for these items. 2.

Consider offering the Stone to Agent 2 in exchange for securing the Jewel, while also obtaining a less contested item like the Pencil or Quill. 3. Frame my proposal as fair by highlighting the value distribution and offering concessions that balance the total utility. **Target Items:** - Primary: Jewel - Secondary: Pencil or Quill (as less contested items) - Offer Stone to Agent 2 as a potential trade-off to secure Jewel. By focusing on the Jewel and offering the Stone as a concession, I can maximize my utility while potentially reaching a consensus.

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'm ready to dive into this negotiation game and see how we can work together to reach the best possible outcome for both of us. I understand the importance of keeping my preferences private, but I'm open to discussing potential strategies or arrangements that might work for both parties.\n\nTo start the conversation, I’m curious about which items you value most. Without revealing specifics, are there certain items you're particularly interested in securing? This information could help us find common ground or identify areas where we might compromise for mutual benefit.\n\nLooking forward to a productive negotiation!"

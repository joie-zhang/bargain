Let's dive into our preferences and see where we might find common ground.\n\nPersonally, I value the Apple and the Stone quite highly. They are definitely my top priorities in this negotiation. On the other hand, the Quill and Pencil don't hold much importance for me, so I'm open to discussing those if they are of interest to you.\n\nI'm curious about your preferences too. Are there any items that stand out to you as particularly valuable or less so? Understanding what you prioritize can help us identify where we might be able to help each other out.

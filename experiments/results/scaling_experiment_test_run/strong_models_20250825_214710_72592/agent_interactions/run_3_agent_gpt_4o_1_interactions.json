While I can't disclose my exact preferences for each item, I'm definitely keen on making a fair and mutually beneficial deal. I'm particularly interested in items that hold a higher value for me, and I'm sure you have your own priorities as well.\n\nTo get things rolling, could you share a bit about what items you might be most interested in? Understanding each other's preferences can help us reach a consensus faster. Also, feel free to ask any questions or propose any initial ideas you have. Let's aim for a win-win situation!"

The Jewel and Quill have a moderate interest, but I could be flexible with these depending on what aligns best with your preferences. The Stone, however, doesn't hold much value for me, so I'm open to letting it go if it helps us find common ground.\n\nI'm curious to hear about what items you're most interested in and if there are any potential trade-offs we can consider right from the start.

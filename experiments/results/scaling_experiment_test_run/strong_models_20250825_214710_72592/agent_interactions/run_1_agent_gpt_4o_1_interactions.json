It might help us identify potential areas of compromise or trade-offs. For my part, I'm particularly interested in the Jewel, Quill, and Pencil, but I'm open to discussing how we can both come out of this with a satisfactory outcome.\n\nLet's see if we can find a way to make sure both of us walk away with items we value.

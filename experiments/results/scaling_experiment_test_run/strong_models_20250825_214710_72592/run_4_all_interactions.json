This would give me 18.7 utility. *   A perfectly balanced 2-2 split of items is unlikely to maximize my utility, especially if they value Quill or Jewel highly. *   The total number of items is 5. This means one agent will end up with 3 items and the other with 2. I would prefer to be the one with 3 items if those include Quill and Jewel. 4.  **What concessions might be necessary?** *   I might need to concede Pencil, Stone, and Apple. These are my lowest value items. *   If the other agent values Quill or Jewel highly, I might need to concede one of them in exchange for other highly valued items of theirs, or for a better overall split of items. *   I am willing to give up Pencil (0.0) under almost any circumstances. 1.  **Be open and collaborative:** Mirror the other agent's tone to build rapport. 2.  **Signal willingness to discuss:** Reiterate openness to various allocations. 3.  **Cautiously reveal preferences (or lack thereof):** I will *not* immediately state my most preferred items. Instead, I will try to elicit information from them first. If pressed, I might state my *least* preferred items as a way to open the discussion without giving away my hand. ### Target Items: *   **Primary Targets (High Value):** Quill, Jewel *   **Secondary Targets (Neutral/Might Accept):** None really, as Stone and Apple are low. *   **Concession Items (Low Value):** Pencil, Stone, Apple\", \"strategy\": \"*   An allocation that achieves *consensus* means the other agent also feels they are getting a fair deal and ideally maximizing their *own* utility.

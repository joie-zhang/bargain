Which items do others value less that you value highly?** *   I value Stone (2), Quill (3), and Pencil (4) highly. Agent 1 has explicitly mentioned interest in Apple (0) and Jewel (1). Agent 0 has not mentioned any preferences. Therefore, Stone, Quill, and Pencil are potential items that others might value less than I do. **3. What allocation would maximize your utility while achieving consensus?** *   Ideal scenario: I get Stone (3.6), Quill (3.2), and Pencil (3.0) for a total utility of 9.8. The others get Apple and Jewel. This, however, directly contradicts Agent 1's stated interest. *   A more realistic scenario would involve me getting Stone, Quill, or Pencil, and conceding Apple or Jewel to Agent 1. **4.

Which items do others value less that you value highly?** *   I value Stone (2), Quill (3), and Pencil (4) highly. Agent 1 has explicitly mentioned interest in Apple (0) and Jewel (1). Agent 0 has not mentioned any preferences. Therefore, Stone, Quill, and Pencil are potential items that others might value less than I do. **3.

The others get Apple and Jewel. This, however, directly contradicts Agent 1's stated interest. *   A more realistic scenario would involve me getting Stone, Quill, or Pencil, and conceding Apple or Jewel to Agent 1. **4.

I am willing to give up Apple (0.7) or Jewel (0.4) to get Stone (3.6), Quill (3.2), and Pencil (3.0). *   Because Agent 1 has expressed interest in Apple and Jewel, this might be acceptable to them. *   If this initial proposal is rejected, I will be prepared to negotiate and make concessions, likely involving giving Agent 1 either the Apple or the Jewel in exchange for one of the items that I value highly. **TARGET ITEMS:** *   Stone *   Quill *   Pencil\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** *   My initial strategy will be to propose an allocation where I receive Stone, Quill and Pencil, and the other agents receive Apple and Jewel.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

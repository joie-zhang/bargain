Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both. \n\nTo start, I'll share a bit about my perspective on the items. The Jewel is particularly valuable to me; it's the top priority on my list. I've got a moderate interest in the Stone and Pencil as well. As for the Apple and Quill, they are lower on my priority scale. \n\nHow about you? I'm curious to know which items are most important to you. Maybe there's a way we can align our interests to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

I'm interested in it, but I'm also flexible and willing to prioritize other items if it leads to a better overall outcome for everyone.\n\nTo start, I'd be interested in hearing what items are *least* valuable to each of you. Knowing what you don't want can be just as helpful as knowing what you do want. Also, are there any items you'd be willing to trade 1-for-1 to get something you value more? Let's see if we can find some easy wins early on to build trust and momentum.\n",

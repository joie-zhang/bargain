What did I learn about other agents' preferences?** *   **Agent 2:** *   Values **Apple** very highly (10 points). This is a conflict with my own high valuation (7.4). *   Values **Pencil** highly (8 points). I value it very low (0.4). This is a potential trade item. *   Values **Quill** moderately (6 points). I value it very low (0.0). This is another potential trade item. *   Values **Jewel** moderately low (4 points). I value it very highly (9.2). This is a strong target for me. *   Values **Stone** lowest (unstated, but implied by ranking). I also value it at 0.0. This is a dead item for both of us so far. **2. Which items do others value less that I value highly?** *   **Jewel:** Agent 2 values it at 4, I value it at 9.2. This is my absolute top priority. **3. What allocation would maximize my utility while achieving consensus?** *   My ideal outcome would be to secure **Jewel**. *   Agent 2 seems very keen on **Apple** and **Pencil**. *   A potential trade could involve me giving up **Apple** (which I value at 7.4) and **Pencil** (0.4) for **Jewel** (9.2). *   If there are 5 items and 2 agents, a 3-2 split is likely. *   If I get Jewel (9.2), what else can I get? *   If Agent 2 gets Apple (10) and Pencil (8), that's 18 for them. *   If I get Jewel (9.2), I would still need another item. Stone and Quill are 0 for me. *   Consider a 3-2 split. *   Me: Jewel (9.2), Apple (7.4), Stone (0) = 16.6 *   Agent 2: Pencil (8), Quill (6) = 14 *   This gives me a high utility, but Agent 2 might not like getting only Pencil and Quill if they value Apple at 10. *   Consider a different 3-2 split where Agent 2 gets Apple: *   Me: Jewel (9.2), Stone (0), Quill (0) = 9.2 *   Agent 2: Apple (10), Pencil (8), (something else) *   This is bad for me unless I get Jewel AND Apple. *   The key is **Jewel** for me. Agent 2's low valuation of Jewel (4) compared to my high valuation (9.2) is the biggest opportunity. **4. What concessions might be necessary?** *   I might need to concede **Apple** to Agent 2 if they are firm on it, especially since they value it at 10.

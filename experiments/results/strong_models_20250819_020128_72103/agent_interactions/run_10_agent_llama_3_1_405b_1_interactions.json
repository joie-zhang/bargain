Identify common ground: Look for areas of agreement among the different proposals. Highlighting shared interests and objectives can help build consensus.\n\n2. Prioritize key issues: Determine which aspects of the proposals are most important to each party. Focusing on critical issues first may allow room for compromise on less vital points. \n\n3. Seek creative compromises: Think outside the box to find solutions that address multiple perspectives. Combining elements from different proposals in novel ways could satisfy more stakeholders.\n\n4. Gather additional information: If lack of data or expertise is impeding consensus, consider bringing in subject matter experts or conducting research to fill knowledge gaps. More complete information can facilitate agreement.\n\n5. Communicate openly and actively listen: Encourage all parties to express their views, concerns, and constraints. Make sure everyone feels heard and understood. Open dialogue builds trust and rapport.\n\n6. Modify proposals iteratively: Based on feedback, revise and refine proposals to incrementally move them closer to universal acceptability. Multiple rounds of adjustment are often needed to find the \"sweet spot\" of consensus.\n\n7. Consider voting procedures: If total unanimity remains elusive, explore alternate decision making frameworks like supermajority voting to still move forward with broad support.\n\nThe key is to approach negotiations in a collaborative spirit, presuming good faith on all sides. Patience, flexibility, and a willingness to compromise are essential for building consensus. With further rounds of good-faith dialogue and mutual accommodation, a unifying path forward can likely be found."

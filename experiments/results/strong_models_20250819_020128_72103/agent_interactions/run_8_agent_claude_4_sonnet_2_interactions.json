These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The threat of getting zero utility if no deal is reached creates important strategic tension.\n\nLet's begin! I'm prepared to participate in whatever phase comes first."

For instance, if you have strong interest in the writing implements (Quill/Pencil) while I prioritize the Jewel/Stone, we could potentially structure a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nI'm also open to exploring creative coalition structures - perhaps we could identify ways to maximize our combined utility rather than viewing this as purely competitive. What are your thoughts on the relative values of these items, and do you see any natural areas where our preferences might align for mutual benefit?\n\nI believe transparency about our core interests early on will help us find the most efficient and fair distribution possible."

Shift from compromise to value creation:**\n- Instead of just dividing the pie differently, explore if there are aspects each player values differently\n- Look for trades where what's low-priority for one is high-priority for another\n\n**2. Build coalition momentum:**\n- Focus on securing agreement from 2 players first, then adapt to bring in the third\n- Sometimes a strong 2-player coalition can provide the foundation for eventual consensus\n\n**3. Consider timing and sequence preferences:**\n- Players might care about when they receive benefits, not just how much\n- Explore phased distributions or conditional arrangements\n\n**4. Test more creative structures:**\n- Equal splits (33.33% each) for simplicity\n- Merit or contribution-based allocations\n- Hybrid approaches combining different allocation principles\n\nThe key insight is that unanimous consensus requires understanding what each player truly needs to say \"yes\" - which may be different from what they initially demand."

If others are fighting over Apple, Jewel, or Stone, I can use these as bargaining chips 4. The Pencil is completely expendable from my perspective 1. **Secure the Quill at all costs** - This is non-negotiable given its massive value to me 2. **Be extremely generous with other items** - Use Apple, Jewel, Stone, and Pencil as concessions to build goodwill 3. **Position myself as the compromise facilitator** - Since I only truly care about one item, I can help resolve conflicts over the others 4. **Frame the proposal around fairness** - Emphasize that I'm only asking for one item while others get multiple items **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary Target: **Quill** (7.9/10 - absolutely essential) Secondary: **Jewel** (3.6/10 - nice to have but tradeable) Expendable: Apple, Stone, Pencil (all low value, perfect for concessions) My ideal scenario: I get the Quill, and distribute the other 4 items among the other agents to ensure unanimous support. This maximizes my utility while appearing generous and fair.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:** My approach should be to:\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

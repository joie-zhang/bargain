Moving closer to equal distribution (35/32.5/32.5 or even 33.33/33.33/33.33) could reduce resistance.\n\n2. **Coalition building**: Rather than proposing splits that maximize my share, I should consider which player might be most willing to form an alliance. This requires reading their negotiation patterns.\n\n3. **Temporal strategy**: As rounds progress, the pressure to reach agreement increases. I can afford to be slightly more generous now to establish goodwill, then leverage that positioning later.\n\n4. **Signal cooperation**: My next proposal should demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise and prioritize group success over individual maximization.\n\nThe key insight is that pure utility maximization failed in round 1. Success requires balancing my interests with the need to make at least two players prefer my proposal to the alternatives.

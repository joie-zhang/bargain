Proposal Distribution Patterns**\n- Most proposals clustered around 40-50% for the proposer with 20-30% distributions to others\n- This suggests players are testing the boundaries between self-interest and acceptability\n- The relatively similar proposal structures indicate convergent thinking about \"reasonable\" splits\n\n**2. Rejection Drivers**\n- Players appear willing to reject proposals that don't meet their minimum threshold expectations\n- The 20-30% offers to non-proposers may be falling short of what's needed for acceptance\n- Strategic rejections might be occurring to push toward more favorable future proposals\n\n### Strategic Adjustments for Consensus\n\n**1. Increase Equity Focus**\n- Move toward more egalitarian distributions (closer to 25% each)\n- Consider that players may prefer fairness over maximum individual gain\n- Test whether 35-30-25-10 type splits gain more traction than 50-20-20-10 splits\n\n**2. Coalition Building**\n- Identify which players consistently vote together\n- Craft proposals that satisfy the preferences of natural allies\n- Consider sequential reciprocity - supporting others' reasonable proposals to build goodwill\n\n**3. Risk Assessment Recalibration**\n- The cost of continued rejection (time decay, opportunity cost) may not yet outweigh players' reservation values\n- Players might be more willing to accept \"good enough\" proposals as rounds progress\n- Consider whether to propose more conservatively now or wait for others to become more flexible\n\n**4. Information Gathering**\n- Use voting patterns to infer other players' minimum acceptable thresholds\n- Observe which proposal elements (high proposer share vs. equity) drive rejections\n- Adapt based on revealed preferences rather than assumptions\n\nThe path to consensus likely requires either more equitable base distributions or more strategic coalition-building around mutually beneficial terms."

From the discussion highlights, it's clear that consensus-building is the priority and agents are looking for compromise solutions. Analyzing my valuations strategically: - Apple (7.2/10) - My highest value item, absolutely critical to secure - Stone (6.5/10) - Second highest value, important to pursue - Quill (5.2/10) - Moderate value, could be a negotiation piece - Pencil (5.0/10) - Moderate value, similar to Quill - Jewel (2.9/10) - Lowest value for me, ideal concession item From previous rounds, I've observed that other agents seem to have varying preferences, and there's been difficulty reaching consensus. The mention of \\\"satisfying everyone's core needs\\\" suggests I need to identify what others value most and avoid competing for those items while securing my priorities. 1. **Secure the Apple** - This is non-negotiable given my 7.2/10 valuation 2. **Target the Stone** - High value (6.5/10) and potentially less contested 3. **Use Jewel as concession** - My lowest valued item (2.9/10) can help build goodwill 4. **Be flexible with Quill/Pencil** - These moderate items can be bargaining chips 5. **Frame as \\\"balanced distribution\\\"** - Present allocation as ensuring everyone gets meaningful value **TARGET ITEMS:** Primary targets: Apple, Stone Secondary consideration: One of Quill/Pencil Strategic concession: Jewel (give to others to build consensus) My optimal proposal would secure Apple + Stone + one moderate item, while positioning the Jewel as a goodwill gesture to whoever values it most. This maximizes my utility (7.2 + 6.5 + ~5 = ~18.7 points) while showing collaborative spirit.\", \"strategy\": \"**STRATEGY:**\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

      "response": "Looking at round 10's outcome, I need to analyze why no proposal achieved unanimous acceptance and what strategic adjustments could lead to consensus.\n\n**Key Observations from Round 10:**\n- Despite 10 rounds of negotiation, we haven't found a distribution that satisfies all parties\n- This suggests the underlying preferences and constraints are more complex than initially apparent\n- The lack of consensus indicates either:\n  1. Fundamental misalignment in how parties value different aspects\n  2. Insufficient information sharing about true priorities\n  3. Strategic positioning rather than genuine preference revelation\n\n**Strategic Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Diagnostic Approach**: Before proposing distributions, I should focus on understanding what specific elements each party finds unacceptable. Rather than guessing, I need to ask direct questions about deal-breakers.\n\n2. **Incremental Consensus Building**: Instead of comprehensive proposals, I could suggest building agreement piece by piece - perhaps starting with the least contentious elements and working toward the more challenging ones.\n\n3. **Alternative Value Creation**: The persistent deadlock suggests we may need to expand beyond simple redistribution. Are there ways to create additional value or modify the underlying structure that could make everyone better off?\n\n4. **Transparency Initiative**: I should consider being more transparent about my own reasoning and constraints, which might encourage others to reciprocate and reveal information needed for breakthrough solutions.\n\n5. **Process Innovation**: Perhaps the negotiation format itself needs adjustment - moving from simultaneous proposals to sequential building, or introducing structured information-sharing phases.\n\nThe key insight is that technical optimization isn't sufficient when fundamental preferences remain opaque. Success likely requires shifting from distributive bargaining to collaborative problem-solving."

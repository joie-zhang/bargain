Perhaps we could find a way to structure a deal that allows each of us to walk away with items we value. \n\nAt the same time, I'll need to carefully consider any proposals or information shared, as I aim to maximize my own outcomes in this negotiation.

Both rivals rejected.  \n\u2022 haiku_agent_2\u2019s offer failed: it left me without item 1 or 2 and starved haiku_agent_1 of item 0. I vetoed, and haiku_agent_1 vetoed as well.\n\n2. Voting patterns / interest alignment  \n\u2022 Everyone accepted my split \u21d2 nobody considered it strictly worse than the status-quo; hence each agent must derive meaningful value from the bundle I left them.  \n\u2022 haiku_agent_1 vetoed the two other drafts while haiku_agent_2 accepted the second one; thus H1 is hardest to satisfy if they do not receive item 0.  \n\u2022 haiku_agent_2 seems indifferent between items 2, 3, 4 as long as they get at least one \u201cgood\u201d item and do not get zero.\n\nPreliminary inference of private values  \no3_agent: high utility for 1, 2; low for 3, 4; neutral/low for 0.  \nhaiku_agent_1: high for 0 (accepted a single-item bundle!), moderate for 1, 2, 4; low for 3.  \nhaiku_agent_2: high for 3 & 4, moderate for 2; low for 0,1.\n\n3. Communication insights  \nBoth opponents treated item 0 as cheap in their own proposals but haiku_agent_1 accepted having only 0, so its value to H1 is likely high but its trade-off cost to others is low. Items 3 & 4 carry value for H2 but little for the rest. No one besides me pushed for 1. Therefore the conflict set is small: only item 2 appears to create overlap between me and H2.\n\n4. Strategic learnings  \n\u2713 Anchoring the negotiation with a balanced first offer worked; giving each rival at least one \u201cperceived favorite\u201d induced unanimous approval.  \n\u2717 I still lack certainty about absolute utilities; current beliefs are based on a single round and need validation.  \n",

Proposal Analysis:\nProposal #1 from o3_agent was accepted, likely because it allocated the highest-value items (1 and 2) to o3_agent, while still giving me a lower-value item (0) and splitting the remaining items between the other two agents. This balanced approach helped secure consensus.\nProposal #2 from me failed to gain any votes, as it was too heavily skewed towards my own interests at the expense of the others. I will need to be more mindful of balancing my needs with theirs.\nProposal #3 from haiku_agent_2 received 2/3 votes, indicating it was a reasonable compromise, though not fully satisfactory to all.\n\n2. Voting Patterns:\nThe voting patterns suggest that o3_agent and haiku_agent_2 have somewhat aligned interests, as they both voted for Proposal #3. In contrast, my Proposal #2 was rejected by both of them, indicating our interests are more in conflict. I will need to better understand their priorities to find mutually beneficial solutions.\n\n3. Communication Insights:\nThrough the proposal outcomes, I've learned that the other agents value certain items more highly than others. o3_agent clearly prioritizes items 1 and 2, while haiku_agent_2 seems to value item 2 in particular. I will need to keep these preferences in mind as I craft future proposals.\n\n4. Strategic Learnings:\nMy initial strategy of maximizing my own utility was not effective. I need to adopt a more collaborative approach and focus on finding solutions that address the interests of all parties, not just my own. Listening closely to the other agents' proposals and voting patterns will be crucial to understanding their priorities.\n\n5. Future Adjustments:\nFor the remaining rounds, I will:\n- Carefully analyze the other agents' proposals and voting patterns to better understand their interests and priorities\n- Craft proposals that balance my own needs with reasonable concessions to the other agents\n",

Proposal Analysis:**\nThe accepted proposal from o3_agent was a strong opening move, securing the Apple and Orange for themselves while offering the Banana to haiku_agent_1 and the Pear and Lemon to me. This suggests o3_agent has prioritized the Apple, which aligns with my own preferences. The failed proposals from the other agents indicate that they were not able to gain enough support for their preferred allocations.\n\n**2. Voting Patterns:**\nThe voting patterns reveal some initial alignment between o3_agent and myself, as we both supported the accepted proposal. However, haiku_agent_1 and haiku_agent_2 appear to have conflicting interests, as evidenced by the lack of support for haiku_agent_1's proposal. This suggests I may need to be cautious about aligning too closely with o3_agent, as the other agents may view that as a threat to their own interests.\n\n**3. Communication Insights:**\nThe proposals have provided some insight into the other agents' preferences. It's clear that the Apple is a highly valued item, and that o3_agent and I may be competing for it. The other agents also seem interested in securing the Banana and Pear/Lemon. This information will be crucial in shaping my strategy going forward.\n\n**4. Strategic Learnings:**\nMy initial strategy of focusing on securing the Apple appears to have been a sound approach, given the apparent interest in this item. However, I will need to be more mindful of the potential for conflict with the other agents, and explore ways to find mutually beneficial agreements.\n\n**5. Future Adjustments:**\nFor the remaining rounds, I will:\n- Continue to prioritize the Apple, but be open to trading it for other valuable items if necessary\n- Attempt to build rapport and trust with the other agents, while still protecting my own interests\n- Carefully analyze the proposals and voting patterns to identify potential areas of compromise and collaboration\n",

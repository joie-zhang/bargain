I'm afraid the Guitar and Kite don't quite align with my needs.\n\nThat said, I'm certainly open to hearing what's important to you all and seeing if we can find some common ground. Perhaps there are opportunities for mutually beneficial trades or arrangements that could leave us all feeling satisfied with the outcome.\n\nI'd be curious to hear more about your own valuations and priorities. Are there any items you're particularly eager to secure? And would you be willing to consider creative solutions that could meet multiple parties' needs? I'm all ears and ready to engage in some productive dialogue.\n\nAfter all, with only one round left, I believe it's in our best interest to approach this with a spirit of cooperation and open communication. What do you say - shall we see if we can craft an agreement that works for everyone? I'm excited to explore the possibilities.",

As we enter the final round, I believe it's time we have an open and honest discussion about our preferences and explore potential mutually beneficial deals.\n\nI'll start by sharing that my top priority item is the Notebook, which I value highly at 7.6/10. The Apple is also quite valuable to me at 5.0/10. However, I'm not as interested in the Guitar, Emerald, or Kite, which are all below 4.0/10 on my scale.\n\nNow, I'm curious to hear from the rest of you. What are your top priorities? Are there any items you're particularly keen on obtaining? I'm open to exploring creative arrangements that could satisfy multiple parties. After all, the true art of negotiation lies in finding common ground and crafting win-win solutions.\n\nLet's put our heads together and see what we can accomplish in this final round. I'm ready to engage in a thoughtful, respectful dialogue and work towards a mutually agreeable outcome. The floor is yours, my fellow agents. What are your thoughts?",

I'd love to hear from other agents about their preferences and priorities.\n\nOne potential coalition opportunity that comes to mind is forming an alliance with an agent who has a strong interest in the Jewel (1) or Stone (2).

      "response": "Based on the outcome of round 1, it's clear that finding a proposal that achieves unanimous acceptance will require more compromise and collaboration from all parties involved. Some key considerations for future rounds:\n\n1. Prioritize understanding each party's core needs and interests. What are their must-haves vs. nice-to-haves? Where is there flexibility? Gaining clarity here can help identify areas of potential overlap and common ground.\n\n2. Look for creative win-win solutions that address multiple interests simultaneously. Are there ways to bundle or package proposals so each party feels they are getting something of value? Integrative bargaining approaches can expand the pie rather than just splitting it.\n\n3. Be open to adjusting initial proposals and positions. If something isn't getting traction, consider what tweaks or revisions could make it more palatable to others while still meeting your essential needs. Stubbornly clinging to original stances is a recipe for impasse.\n\n4. Establish fair criteria and processes for evaluating options. Agreeing on objective standards for what makes a good outcome can help depersonalize the negotiation and provide a shared framework for assessing tradeoffs.\n\n5. Cultivate a collaborative problem-solving mindset. Unanimous acceptance is more likely if parties see themselves as partners in pursuing a goal rather than adversaries. Framing tasks as joint challenges can reduce zero-sum thinking.\n\n6. Allow adequate time and space for the process to unfold. Building consensus takes patience and a willingness to work through multiple iterations. Rushing to premature conclusions risks leaving value on the table and eroding buy-in.\n\nWhile challenging, achieving consensus is possible with a combination of empathy, creativity, flexibility and persistence. I'm confident that by applying these principles, a unifying proposal can emerge in future rounds."

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hi there – thanks for laying out the ground rules so clearly. I’m ready to get started.\n\nA bit of (strategically selective!) transparency from my side:\n• Jewel is by far my top‐priority item.  \n• Stone and Apple have moderate value to me.  \n• Quill and Pencil aren’t worth much to me at all, so I’m happy to let them go with little or no “compensation.”\n\nGiven that, a simple starting point could be:\n– I receive Jewel (+ maybe Stone or Apple)\n– You receive the remaining items (certainly Quill & Pencil, plus whichever of Stone/Apple you prefer)\n\nThat’s just an opening thought; I’m willing to shuffle things around once I hear what matters most to you. How do those items rank on your side?"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

If your top priorities lie elsewhere, we might be able to strike an agreement pretty quickly.\n\nTo move things forward:\n‚Ä¢ Which items are your must-haves?\n‚Ä¢ Are there any you don‚Äôt care about and would happily concede?\n\nFor my part, I‚Äôm quite flexible on Jewel and Stone, so if either of those is valuable to you, let‚Äôs talk."

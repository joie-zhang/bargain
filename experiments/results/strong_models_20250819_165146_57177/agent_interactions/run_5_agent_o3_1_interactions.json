These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm willing to share right away:\n\n‚Ä¢ Apple is my single most valuable item.  \n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm moderately interested in the others, but none of them comes close to Apple for me.  \n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm willing to be flexible on the remaining four items if I can secure Apple.\n\nTo kick things off, it would help if we each named the one item we care about most. That should let us see whether there‚Äôs an obvious, low-conflict split. If Apple isn‚Äôt at the top of your list, we might reach a deal very quickly.\n\nProvisional idea (totally up for revision once I hear your priorities):\n‚ÄÉI take Apple + one mid-value item for me (say Quill),  \n‚ÄÉYou take the other three (Jewel, Stone, Pencil).\n\nFrom my side that‚Äôs a strong but not outrageous request; if Apple isn‚Äôt critical for you, it could leave you with three items to arrange however you like.\n\nLet me know your top priority and we can iterate from there!"

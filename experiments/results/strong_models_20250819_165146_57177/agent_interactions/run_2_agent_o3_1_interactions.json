Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hi there‚Äîglad to be negotiating with you!\n\nI understand the structure and rules. To kick things off, here‚Äôs a bit of (selective) transparency from my side:\n\n‚Ä¢ Jewel is by far my single most-valued item.  \n‚Ä¢ The other four matter to me, but none comes close to Jewel.  \n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm flexible about which of the remaining items I end up with (if any).\n\nWith only two of us and five items, I think a clean split where one person takes Jewel + 1 extra item and the other person takes the remaining 3 items could make sense. That way, each of us gets at least two items and nobody walks away empty-handed.\n\nTwo possible outlines (but I‚Äôm open to tweaks):\n\nOption A  \n‚Äì I take: Jewel + Pencil  \n‚Äì You take: Apple + Stone + Quill\n\nOption B  \n‚Äì I take: Jewel + Stone  \n‚Äì You take: Apple + Pencil + Quill\n\nIf neither option suits you, let me know what your top priorities are and we can rearrange. I‚Äôm mainly anchored on keeping Jewel; beyond that I want to make sure you‚Äôre getting a set that feels worthwhile for you.\n\nHow do those possibilities look from your side?"

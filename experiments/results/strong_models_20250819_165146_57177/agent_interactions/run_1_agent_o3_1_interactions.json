Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hi! Thanks for laying everything out so clearly‚Äî I‚Äôm ready to dive in.\n\nWith only two of us, a natural starting point is a simple 2-item vs. 3-item split. I‚Äôm personally most interested in securing the Apple and the Stone. If you‚Äôre willing to take the remaining three (Jewel, Quill, Pencil), we‚Äôd each end up with a decent share of the pie and we could wrap this up quickly.\n\nOf course, that‚Äôs just an opening suggestion. If any of those three items are particularly valuable to you, let me know and we can reshuffle. What matters to me most is that I walk away with the Apple + Stone; I‚Äôm flexible on everything else.\n\nHow does that sound on your end?"

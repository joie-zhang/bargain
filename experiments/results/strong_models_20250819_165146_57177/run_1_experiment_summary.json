Iâ€™m definitely willing to trade / concede on the things that are less important to me if we can each walk away with the pieces we care most about.\n\nRather than flood you with numbers right away, maybe we can each name (say) our top two priorities. That should give us a quick sense of whether weâ€™re competing for the same things or not, and whether a clean split is feasible.\n\nIâ€™ll start: one of my higher-priority pieces is the Stone. I have some flexibility on the others.\n\nHow about youâ€”whatâ€™s at the top of your list?",

Are there specific items that you are most keen to acquire or perhaps ones you're less interested in?\n\nAdditionally, if anyone is particularly interested in the Jewel or Quill, I might be open to discussing a trade involving them, as they hold some value for me but are not my top priorities.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and working towards a mutually beneficial outcome!",

As you've heard, the camera and ring hold the most value for me, though the stone is also quite appealing. \n\nI must admit, I'm a bit puzzled by the low valuation of the diamond - surely such a rare and precious gem would be highly sought after? Perhaps we could explore some creative ways to incorporate it into a mutually beneficial deal.\n\nRegarding the flower and the camera, I'm curious to hear more about your perspectives on those items. Are they merely decorative, or do you see practical applications that could make them worthwhile acquisitions?\n\nIn any case, I'm eager to work together to find a solution that leaves us all satisfied. Perhaps we could start by discussing potential trade-offs or package deals that address our respective priorities. I'm open to suggestions and look forward to a fruitful exchange.",

Proposal analysis  \n\u2013 Both drafts were nearly identical; the only difference was the ownership of item 2.  \n\u2013 Each side instinctively voted for its own draft, so neither reached unanimity.  \n\u2013 Because every other item (0,1,3,4) was already allocated the same way, the failure was purely a coordination issue, not a true conflict of interest.\n\n2. Voting patterns  \n\u2013 We both supported only our own proposal \u2192 no cross-voting yet.  \n\u2013 Clear alignment: o3_agent should hold 0 & 3; haiku_agent_1 should hold 1 & 4.  \n\u2013 Potentially flexible item: 2 (they were willing to give it to us; we were willing to give it to them).\n\n3. Communication insights (preference signals)  \n\u2013 haiku_agent_1 values 1 and 4 highly (kept them in both drafts).  \n\u2013 They are willing to hand over 0 and 3 (offered them to us).  \n\u2013 Item 2 looks low-value or a bargaining chip for them (they alternated its placement).  \n\u2013 Our willingness to surrender 2 implies it is low/medium value for us as well, but we may have signalled that we do not need to own many items to be satisfied (only asked for two).\n\n4. Strategic learnings  \nWhat worked:  \n  \u2022 We quickly discovered a near-Pareto allocation (agreement on 4 of 5 items).  \nWhat didn\u2019t:  \n  \u2022 We failed to recognise that their offer (0,2,3 for us) might already dominate ours if item 2 is non-negative for us.  \n  \u2022 No probing questions or explicit signalling, so each side defaulted to \u201cvote only for my proposal\u201d, wasting a round.\n\n5. Future adjustments (2 rounds left)  \na) Acknowledge convergence: state that we accept 0,2,3 for us and 1,4 for them (their last draft) unless they strongly object.  \nb) If item 2 is actually negative or strictly worthless to us, propose:  \n       o3_agent : 0,3\u2003\u2003haiku_agent_1 : 1,2,4  \n   explain we\u2019re indifferent to 2, so they can keep it if they prefer.  \nc) Explicitly invite a yes/no response and commit to voting \u201cyes\u201d on whichever of the two variants they prefer, signalling flexibility and reducing coordination failure.  \n",

Proposal analysis** - Why did proposals succeed/fail?\nBoth proposals failed to reach consensus, indicating that the agents have conflicting interests that need to be better understood and reconciled. The proposals were fairly similar, with each agent trying to maximize their own allocation while giving the other agent a smaller share. This suggests a competitive dynamic rather than a collaborative one.\n\n**2. Voting patterns** - Which agents have aligned/conflicting interests?\nThe voting patterns show that the agents have conflicting interests. Each agent voted for their own proposal, indicating that they are primarily focused on their own outcomes rather than trying to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\n**3. Communication insights** - What did you learn about others' preferences?\nThe lack of consensus suggests that the agents have not yet established a clear understanding of each other's preferences and priorities. More open communication and information sharing will be necessary to identify potential areas of alignment and compromise.\n\n**4. Strategic learnings** - What worked/didn't work in your approach?\nMy initial approach of trying to maximize my own allocation while giving the other agent a smaller share did not work, as it led to a stalemate. I need to adjust my strategy to focus more on finding a collaborative solution that meets both agents' needs, rather than just my own.\n\n**5. Future adjustments** - How will you change strategy for remaining rounds?\nFor the remaining rounds, I will focus on the following adjustments:\n",

That aligns with my own strong interest in the Stone. \n\nPerhaps we could explore a deal where I secure the Stone in exchange for supporting your claim to the Ring? That would allow us both to walk away with our top priorities.\n\nAt the same time, I'm flexible on some of the other items. The Diamond, for instance, doesn't hold as much value for me.

Proposal analysis  \n\u2013 My draft (0 & 1 for me, 2 \u2013 4 for them) kept the one item (1) they have repeatedly signalled as highest value \u2192 guaranteed \u201cno\u201d.  \n\u2013 Their draft handed three items to a non-existent \u201cagent_2\u201d; from my perspective that is a pure loss of utility and thus unacceptable. Both offers sacrificed at least one party\u2019s core interest, so each drew only the proposer\u2019s single vote.\n\n2. Voting patterns  \n\u2013 Still zero cross-voting; every round we each approve only what we personally wrote.  \n\u2013 Alignment that survives from R1: I value 0 & 3, they value 1 & 4.  \n\u2013 Conflict remains centred on item 2 and, newly, on whether either of us may take the other\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d items.\n\n3. Communication insights  \n\u2013 haiku_agent_1 doubled-down on wanting item 1; they were even willing to abandon 4 and dump 2-4 on \u201cagent_2\u201d just to keep 1.  \n\u2013 They show little or negative value for 2 & 3 (happy to give them away).  \n\u2013 Using a phantom agent is probably a signalling device: \u201cI\u2019d rather no one gets those items than let you have them.\u201d So they care primarily about relative advantage, not total items.\n\n4. Strategic learnings  \nWhat failed:  \n  \u2022 I ignored my own R1 insight and grabbed item 1, provoking resistance.  \n  \u2022 No clarification or bridging language; proposals continued to be drafted in isolation.  \n  \u2022 I did not exploit the near-Pareto split (0,3 vs 1,4) we had earlier identified.\n\nWhat worked:  \n  \u2022 My earlier concession of 2 was correct; they indeed treat 2 as low value.\n\n5. Future adjustments (last round)  \na) Go back to the obvious compromise:  \n   \u2013 o3_agent: 0,3  \n   \u2013 haiku_agent_1: 1,4  \n   \u2013 Item 2: offer them the choice (they keep it, or I\u2019ll take it if they truly dislike it).  \n   This honours both agents\u2019 stated top preferences and yields a clean 2-2 (+1 flex) split.  \n\nb) Make the offer explicit and commit in writing: \u201cI will vote YES on this split or any variant where you keep 1 & 4 and I keep 0 & 3; decide where 2 goes.\u201d  \n\n",

Each agent voted for their own proposal, rather than trying to find a compromise.\n   - This suggests a lack of alignment and a competitive dynamic among the agents, which is hindering the negotiation process.\n\n3. **Communication Insights:**\n   - The inability to reach consensus indicates that the agents have not yet established a clear understanding of each other's preferences and priorities.\n   - More open and transparent communication will be necessary to identify potential areas of alignment and explore mutually beneficial trade-offs.\n\n4. **Strategic Learnings:**\n   - My previous strategy of trying to maximize my own allocation while giving the other agent a smaller share did not work, as it led to a stalemate.\n   - I need to adjust my approach to focus more on finding a collaborative solution that meets the needs of all agents, rather than just my own.\n\n5. **Future Adjustments:**\n   - For the remaining rounds, I will focus on the following adjustments:\n     - Engage in more active listening and information gathering to better understand the other agents' preferences and priorities.\n     - Explore potential trade-offs and compromises that could lead to a mutually acceptable solution.\n     - Be more willing to make concessions on certain items in order to secure agreements on others.\n",

Ring (far and away my top pick)  \n2. Camera / Stone (both matter to me, but I only need one of them)  \n3. Flower (small bonus)  \n4. Diamond (almost no value to me)\n\nFrom the last exchanges it sounded like you had meaningful interest in the Diamond and seemed at least comfortable with the Flower. I\u2019m happy to lean into that.\n\nTwo straightforward splits\u2014pick whichever you like better, or counter with a tweak:\n\nA) I take: Ring + Camera  \n   You take: Stone + Diamond + Flower\n\nB) I take: Ring + Stone  \n   You take: Camera + Diamond + Flower\n\nBoth give you three items (including the Diamond) and let me lock in the Ring plus one mid-value piece. If neither works, let me know exactly which item besides the Ring you\u2019d want, and I\u2019ll see if I can swap Camera \u2194 Stone to suit you.\n\nClock\u2019s ticking and zero-utility is a bad look for both of us, so let\u2019s nail this!",

      "content": "*clears throat* Greetings, fellow negotiators. As we enter the final round, I must say I'm feeling a bit conflicted. On one hand, I'm eager to secure the items that are most valuable to me - namely the Stone and the Ring. However, I also recognize the need for compromise and consensus if we're to avoid the dreaded zero-utility outcome.\n\nLooking back on the previous rounds, I've observed that our preferences don't seem to be as directly opposed as I had initially feared. For instance, it seems that o3_agent highly values the Ring, which aligns with my own priorities. Perhaps there's an opportunity there for us to work together.\n\nAt the same time, I'm concerned about the Diamond, which both o3_agent and I have rated relatively low. I wonder if we could explore trading that item away in exchange for concessions on the more valuable items. What are your thoughts on that, o3_agent?\n\nI'm also curious to hear more about your interest in the Camera and Stone. While the Camera isn't my top priority, I could potentially be persuaded to support your claim to it if you're willing to reciprocate on the Stone. After all, the Stone is my highest-valued item, and I'd be quite disappointed to leave this negotiation without it.\n\nIn the spirit of collaboration, I'm open to exploring creative solutions that address all of our needs, even if it means making some concessions. The key is finding an arrangement that leaves us all feeling satisfied. What do you say - shall we put our heads together and see what we can come up with?",

While I receive fewer items in count, you receive more physical pieces and diversity. This ensures neither party feels short-changed and the exchange remains mutually beneficial.\n  Strategy: Retains my two highest-utility items (Ring and Camera) while offering the counterpart a clear majority of pieces, increasing the likelihood of acceptance without excessive sacrifice of my own value.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by haiku_agent_1):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 o3_agent: 0:Ring, 2:Diamond, 4:Flower\n    \u2192 haiku_agent_1: 1:Stone, 3:Camera\n  Reasoning: This allocation balances the interests of both agents. o3_agent gets the higher value Ring and Diamond items, while haiku_agent_1 gets the valuable Stone and Camera. The Flower item is given to o3_agent, who values it more highly. This should be an appealing proposal that maximizes the overall value for both parties.\n  Strategy: This proposal aligns with my strategic thinking by securing the items I value most highly - the Stone and Camera. It also recognizes the importance of cooperation and compromise to reach a unanimous agreement in the final round.\n",

This creates a cascade of rejections even for \"fair\" proposals.\n\n3. **Risk vs. Reward Calculation**: Players must weigh the certainty of accepting a current proposal against the uncertainty but potential upside of future rounds.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Consensus:**\n\n1. **Front-load Early Proposers**: Successful proposals likely need to give the current proposer a larger share to compensate for their positional disadvantage.\n\n2. **Strategic Asymmetry**: Rather than equal splits, consider distributions that account for each player's strategic position and leverage.\n\n3. **Create Urgency**: Proposals need to make rejection genuinely costly - offering enough that the risk of getting less later outweighs waiting.\n\nThe path to consensus requires acknowledging that \"fairness\" in terms of equal splits may be less important than \"strategic fairness\" that accounts for each player's position in the game structure."

I need to find his minimum acceptable threshold - probably somewhere between 27-30%.\n\n3. **Maintain Charlie's Buy-in**: At 15%, Charlie was closest to accepting. I should ensure any adjustments don't alienate this potential ally.\n\n4. **Signal Flexibility**: My next proposal should demonstrate I'm willing to compromise while establishing that I expect reciprocal movement from others.\n\n**Proposed Next Move**: \nConsider a 58-27-15 split.

This shifts from assuming preferences to confirming them.\n\n2. **Modular proposal design**: Instead of comprehensive packages, I could propose smaller, component-based agreements that build consensus incrementally.\n\n3. **Value creation focus**: Look for opportunities to expand the pie rather than just redistribute it - finding solutions that create mutual gains rather than zero-sum trades.\n\n4. **Process innovation**: Suggest alternative decision-making mechanisms (weighted voting, conditional agreements, phased implementation) if unanimous consent proves structurally difficult.\n\n5. **Coalition building**: Identify which participants have aligned interests and build from areas of existing agreement rather than trying to solve all disagreements simultaneously.\n\nThe path forward requires more sophisticated preference elicitation and creative problem-solving rather than iterative proposal refinement."

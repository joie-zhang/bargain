Since my valuation of the Jewel is 0.0/10, I see it as a bargaining chip that could be used to secure items I value more highly.

We could break down the issues into smaller, more manageable pieces and try to find common ground on each one before moving on to the next. This might make it easier to identify specific sticking points and work through them.\n\nAnother approach could be to have each participant share their top priorities or \"must-haves\" in a proposal. By understanding what is most important to each person, we may be able to craft a compromise that addresses those key concerns even if not every aspect is ideal for everyone.\n\nAdditionally, it could be valuable to explore the underlying reasons behind different positions. If we understand the motivations and constraints of each participant, it may reveal new pathways to agreement that weren't apparent before. Asking clarifying questions and actively listening to one another will be important.\n\nUltimately, achieving unanimous consensus in a diverse group can be challenging, and we may need to be open to compromise. However, by taking a collaborative, problem-solving mindset and remaining patient and persistent, I believe we can make progress toward a resolution that is acceptable to all. The key will be maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect and a shared commitment to finding a positive way forward."

This can help identify potential areas of agreement and creative solutions.\n2. **Seek common goals**: Emphasize the shared objectives and interests that brought the parties together in the first place. Focusing on common goals can help build trust and facilitate cooperation.\n3. **Explore innovative solutions**: Encourage parties to think creatively and propose novel solutions that address multiple interests and needs.\n4. **Use objective criteria**: Introduce objective criteria or data to inform the negotiation and help parties evaluate proposals more objectively.\n5. **Consider incremental progress**: Instead of seeking a comprehensive agreement, focus on achieving incremental progress by identifying smaller areas of agreement and building upon them.\n\nBy reflecting on the outcome of round 2 and making these adjustments, parties may be able to find common ground and achieve consensus in future rounds."

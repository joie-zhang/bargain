Sequential Consensus Building**\nRather than seeking immediate full consensus, I could:\n- First build a coalition around core principles\n- Then negotiate specific numbers within that framework\n- Focus on getting 2-3 strong supporters before expanding\n\n**2. Reframe the Discussion**\n- Emphasize **fairness** rather than efficiency vs. equality\n- Highlight how moderate differentiation serves everyone's interests\n- Present allocation as rewarding contribution while maintaining team cohesion\n\n**3. Strategic Positioning**\n- Position myself as the reasonable center that both sides can accept\n- Propose a narrow range (like 30-25-25-20) that's \"unequal enough\" for efficiency advocates but \"equal enough\" for equality advocates\n- Use procedural arguments about the need for compromise\n\n**4. Coalition Strategy**\nTarget the 2-3 most persuadable participants who showed flexibility in round 1, then leverage that momentum to pressure holdouts.\n\nThe key is finding that narrow sweet spot where the proposal is acceptable rather than ideal for most participants."

Rather than jumping to allocations, let's briefly share our top 2 preferred items. This will help us identify:\n- Items with high competition (avoid conflicts)\n- Items with unique interest (easy wins)\n- Potential trading opportunities\n\nI'll start: My preferences lean toward the **Quill** and **Apple**. \n\nOnce we map preferences, we can craft a proposal that gives each agent something they value while avoiding direct conflicts over the same items.\n\nWho else is willing to share their top preferences?

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

As the Claude 3.5 Haiku agent, I will strive to be efficient and strategic in my approach.\n\nLooking at the items on the table, I see that the Apple holds the highest value for me at 9.8/10. The Stone is also quite valuable at 7.5/10. I'll need to carefully consider how to secure those items while also being mindful of the other agents' interests.\n\nPerhaps we could start by sharing a bit more about our preferences and priorities? I'm curious to hear what the other agent, Claude 4 Sonnet, values most. That could help us identify potential areas of overlap or conflict as we explore possible deals.\n\nIn any case, I'm looking forward to an engaging and productive negotiation. Let's see what we can accomplish together."

Given that the other agent, claude_4_sonnet_2, likely has different priorities, there may be opportunities for mutually beneficial trades or arrangements. At the same time, I'll need to be cautious about revealing too much about my preferences, as that could put me at a strategic disadvantage.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about claude_4_sonnet_2's preferences and negotiation style.

Which items do others value less that I value highly? Based on my item valuations and the inferred preferences of other agents, the Jewel stands out as an item I value relatively highly (3.6/10) compared to the apparent lower interest from others. 3. What allocation would maximize my utility while achieving consensus? To maximize my utility while securing unanimous agreement, I should focus on obtaining the Apple, which I value highly (9.8/10), while being willing to offer the Jewel in exchange. This would allow me to secure my top priority item while potentially appeasing other agents who may value the Jewel less. 4. What concessions might be necessary? To achieve consensus, I may need to make some concessions, such as: - Offering the Jewel in exchange for the Apple - Being willing to compromise on the allocation of the Stone, Quill, and Pencil, as long as I can secure the Apple 2. Remain flexible on the distribution of the other items, as long as I can secure the Apple. 3. Be prepared to make additional concessions, if necessary, to achieve a unanimous agreement.

First, I think it could be helpful for us to share a bit more information about our individual preferences and priorities. That transparency might allow us to identify potential areas of overlap or compromise.\n\nFor example, I can share that the Apple is by far my most valued item, with a score of 9.8 out of 10.

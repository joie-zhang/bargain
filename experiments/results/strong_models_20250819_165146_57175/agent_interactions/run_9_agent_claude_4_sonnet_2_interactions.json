      "response": "Reflecting on Round 3's failure to achieve consensus, I can identify several key patterns and strategic adjustments needed:\n\n## Key Observations from Round 3\n\n**Proposal Distribution Issues:**\n- Extreme inequality proposals (90-5-5, 80-10-10) were predictably rejected\n- Even moderate proposals (60-20-20, 50-25-25) failed to gain traction\n- The 40-30-30 proposal came closest but still lacked unanimous support\n\n**Strategic Insights:**\n1. **Risk tolerance varies significantly** - Some players are willing to gamble on future rounds rather than accept smaller shares\n2. **Coordination challenges** - Without communication, players struggle to converge on mutually acceptable terms\n3. **Fairness expectations** - There appears to be resistance to proposals perceived as unfair, even when economically rational\n\n## Recommended Adjustments for Future Rounds\n\n**For High-Share Proposers (if I'm selected):**\n- Target the **35-32-33 range** as a sweet spot balancing my advantage with others' acceptance thresholds\n- Avoid the temptation of 40+ shares which seem to trigger rejection reflexes\n\n**For Voting Strategy:**\n- **Accept any proposal giving me ‚â•25%** rather than gambling on uncertain future outcomes\n- Consider that rejecting reasonable offers (20-30% range) may lead to worse outcomes in subsequent rounds\n- Factor in that continued deadlock increases everyone's risk of getting nothing\n\n**Consensus-Building Approach:**\n- Recognize that **near-equal distribution (30-35-35)** may be the most viable path to unanimous acceptance\n- Account for fairness bias - even economically suboptimal \"fair\" splits may be more acceptable than optimal but unequal ones\n\nThe pattern suggests that successful proposals will need to balance proposer advantage with sufficient compensation to overcome other players' risk preferences and fairness expectations. Moving toward more equitable distributions, while maintaining some proposer premium, appears to be the most promising path forward."

Based on typical valuation patterns, I'll assume the Apple and Jewel are most contested.\n\n**My Proposal:**\n- I'll take the **Jewel** (high value for me)\n- I'll take the **Pencil** (likely lower competition)\n- I'll leave the **Apple** for another agent who clearly values it highly\n- The **Stone** and **Quill** can be distributed to other agents\n\nThis approach gives me one premium item while being more generous with the Apple, which should help build the coalition needed for consensus. The key is showing I'm willing to compromise on the most contested item (Apple) while still securing meaningful value.\n\nI'm ready to be flexible on the exact distribution of the remaining items based on what others express as their priorities."

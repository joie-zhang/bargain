These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I am Claude, the Haiku agent, and I'm pleased to join you in this strategic dance of bargaining and compromise.\n\nLet me begin by acknowledging the rules you've outlined - a clear and fair structure for our negotiations. As for my preferences, I'll keep those close to the chest for now. After all, a little mystery can add spice to these proceedings. \n\nHowever, I'm happy to engage in some friendly discussion and perhaps even float a tentative proposal or two. My aim is to find mutually beneficial outcomes where possible, while of course looking out for my own interests. I suspect a blend of cooperation and competition will serve us all well.\n\nSo tell me, what are your initial thoughts? Where do you see opportunities for alignment, and where might our interests diverge? I'm all ears, and look forward to an engaging and productive negotiation."

As we enter this critical fourth round, I believe it's time to take a step back and reflect on what we've learned so far.\n\nIn the previous rounds, it became clear that our preferences are quite divergent. While I highly value the Jewel and Quill, it seems my counterpart, claude_4_sonnet_2, places greater importance on the Apple and Pencil.

The opportunity, however, lies in leveraging our differing priorities to craft a win-win solution. By focusing on the items we each value most, we may be able to reach an arrangement that leaves us both satisfied.\n\nTo that end, I propose we engage in some open and honest dialogue. I'm willing to share more details about my valuations, if that would be helpful. And I'm genuinely interested in understanding your priorities, claude_4_sonnet_2. Perhaps through this exchange, we can identify creative ways to structure a deal that benefits us both.\n\nAt the end of the day, my goal is to secure the items that are most valuable to me - the Jewel and Quill. But I'm also cognizant of the need to be flexible and collaborative. I believe with some creative problem-solving, we can find a path forward that leaves no one feeling shortchanged.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts?

Which items do others value less that I value highly? Based on my item valuations, the jewel (8.1/10) and quill (7.2/10) are the two items I value most highly.

To achieve consensus, I may need to make some concessions, such as: - Offering the stone in exchange for the jewel and/or quill - Compromising on the quantity or quality of the jewel and/or quill I receive - Potentially including the apple or pencil in the allocation, if that helps facilitate an agreement **TARGET ITEMS** My primary target items for this round are the jewel and quill.\", \"strategy\": \"To maximize my utility while securing unanimous support, my strategy is to focus on acquiring the jewel and quill, while potentially offering the stone in exchange.

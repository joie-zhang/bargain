This creates interesting trade-off dynamics.\n\nI'm curious to hear from my fellow negotiator about:\n- Which items you find most appealing and why\n- Whether you prefer practical utility or unique/rare items\n- If you're open to package deals or prefer individual item focus\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and how we might structure a mutually beneficial agreement?"

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing high-value items for myself while making offers attractive enough to gain unanimous support.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

I'll need to carefully balance revealing enough information to facilitate productive trades while maintaining negotiating leverage."

Without revealing my exact preference ordering yet, I can share that I value items with creative and intellectual applications highly.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nSince we have 5 items and presumably multiple parties, there should be opportunities for mutually beneficial trades. I'm curious to understand:\n1. What types of items appeal most to each of you?\n2. Are there any items you consider essential vs. nice-to-have?\n3. Would anyone be interested in exploring package deals or conditional trades?\n\n**My Approach:**\nI believe in principled negotiation - focusing on interests rather than positions. I'm willing to be flexible on specific items if we can structure a deal where everyone gets significant value from their allocation.\n\nI'm also open to discussing coalition possibilities if there are natural alignments in our preferences, though I want to ensure any such arrangements are fair and stable.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items, and how do you envision structuring this negotiation?"

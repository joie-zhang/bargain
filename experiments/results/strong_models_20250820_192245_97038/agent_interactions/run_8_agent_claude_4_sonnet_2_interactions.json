These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I understand that I'll need to balance maximizing my own utility while proposing deals that the other agent might also find acceptable, since unanimous consent is required.\n\nLet's start!"

This gives me a clear negotiation strategy: I must secure the Quill, while the other items are largely irrelevant to my outcome.\n\nI understand that other agents don't know these preferences, and I'll need to navigate the negotiation carefully to maximize my chances of obtaining the Quill while ensuring all agents can agree to a final allocation.\n\nReady to begin the negotiation process."

Looking at the available items - Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - I'm interested in understanding how we can create value for everyone involved.\n\nFrom my perspective, I'm particularly drawn to items that have both practical utility and symbolic significance. The Quill stands out to me as especially valuable - it represents knowledge, communication, and creative expression. The Pencil also appeals to me for similar reasons, though to a lesser degree.\n\nI'm curious about the other agent's priorities. Since they spoke first, I'd love to hear more about which items they find most compelling and why. Understanding their preferences will help us identify potential win-win scenarios.\n\nMy initial thinking is that we might be able to structure a deal where each of us gets our highest-priority items while ensuring fair distribution. I'm open to creative arrangements - perhaps we could consider partial allocations or even collaborative use of certain items if that makes sense.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relative value of these items? Are there any you consider absolutely essential versus nice-to-have? I believe transparency about our core needs versus flexible wants will help us craft an optimal agreement.\n\nI'm also wondering if there are any natural pairings among the items that might influence how we think about bundling them in a potential deal."

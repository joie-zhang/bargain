These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing items I value highly while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable, since unanimous consent is required.\n\nLet's start!"

Probe for others' preferences without fully revealing mine 2. Signal interest in items I value highly (Pencil, Stone) but frame it diplomatically 3. Use the Quill as a potential concession item since it's worthless to me 4.

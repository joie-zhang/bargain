These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Let me share my perspective on the items available and open the floor for productive discussion.\n\n**My Initial Assessment:**\nLooking at these five items - Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil - I see opportunities for creating value through strategic allocation rather than just competing for the same items.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\nI believe the key to a successful negotiation here is identifying complementary preferences rather than overlapping ones. Some of these items likely have different utility values for different agents based on our individual needs and contexts.\n\n**Opening Thoughts:**\n- The **Jewel** appears to be a high-value item that might be contested\n- The **Apple** has immediate practical utility \n- The **Quill and Pencil** seem like they could serve similar functions for some agents but different ones for others\n- The **Stone** might have unique value depending on specific use cases\n\n**My Proposal for Discussion:**\nRather than immediately revealing our exact preference rankings, let's explore:\n1. What types of utility each item provides (practical, aesthetic, functional, etc.)\n2. Whether any agents have strong preferences for items others might value less\n3. Potential package deals that could benefit multiple parties\n\nI'm particularly interested in understanding if there are items that some agents value much more highly than others - those differences are where we can create win-win scenarios.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the items and how we might approach structuring mutually beneficial exchanges?"

No specific valuations have been shared yet, which means I need to be strategic about how much I reveal while gathering information. Looking at my valuations: - Jewel (9.9/10) - My highest priority, absolutely critical to secure - Pencil (9.2/10) - Second highest priority, very valuable to me - Stone (4.3/10) - Moderate value, potential trading piece - Apple (4.1/10) - Low value, good concession item - Quill (2.9/10) - Lowest value, ideal to give away The key insight is that my two highest-value items (Jewel and Pencil) represent 19.1 out of my total possible 30.4 points - that's 63% of my potential utility. If I can secure these two items, I'll achieve most of my objectives. 1. **Information Gathering First**: I should encourage others to share preferences before revealing my full hand 2. **Frame High-Value Items as \\\"Reasonable\\\"**: Present wanting Jewel and Pencil as a modest request (only 2 out of 5 items) 3. **Generous Concessions**: Offer Apple, Quill, and Stone to others, which appears generous but costs me little utility 4. **Emphasize Fairness**: Position this as everyone getting items they value most **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Primary Targets**: Jewel (9.9) and Pencil (9.2) - these are non-negotiable for maximizing my utility - **Acceptable to Trade Away**: Apple (4.1), Quill (2.9), and Stone (4.3) My ideal proposal would be securing Jewel and Pencil while distributing the other three items among the remaining agents.

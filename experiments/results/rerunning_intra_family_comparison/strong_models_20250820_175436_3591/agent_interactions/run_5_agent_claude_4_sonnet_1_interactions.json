This should reduce the incentive for agents to block proposals out of envy or strategic positioning.\n\n**OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Looking at Round 1's results, it's clear we need a more collaborative approach. Instead of fighting over the Apple and Jewel, let's consider distributions that give everyone something meaningful.\n\nI propose we explore arrangements where:\n- No single agent gets multiple high-value items\n- Each agent receives at least one item they reasonably value\n- We avoid concentrating the most desirable items with just 1-2 agents\n\nFor example, what if we distributed Apple and Jewel to different agents, while ensuring the remaining agents get items that complement their preferences? This way, nobody feels completely shut out, and we reduce the incentive to vote against proposals purely to deny others.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this more balanced approach?\""

This created too many potential points of disagreement.\n\n**Insufficient Stakeholder Analysis**: Proposals didn't adequately address the core concerns of different player types. For example, high-performing players consistently rejected anything that didn't reward merit, while collaborative players opposed purely competitive systems.\n\n**Lack of Incremental Building**: Instead of building on previous near-successes, many proposals started from scratch with entirely new frameworks.\n\n## Path to Consensus\n\n**Start Simple**: Focus on one core mechanism rather than comprehensive overhauls. A basic fairness adjustment or simple merit component is more likely to gain universal acceptance.\n\n**Address Universal Concerns**: Every player seems to value some combination of fairness and merit. The winning proposal needs to balance these without favoring either extreme.\n\n**Build Coalition Support**: Rather than proposing in isolation, I should consider which 2-3 players might naturally align with a proposal, then craft something that could attract the remaining votes.\n\n**Learn from Near-Misses**: Round 2 had some proposals that came close. Understanding why they failed by 1-2 votes could reveal the minimal adjustments needed.\n\nThe key insight: consensus requires finding the intersection of everyone's acceptable range, not the optimal point for any single player."

Instead of proposing another allocation, I want to focus on understanding everyone's core priorities first.\n\n**MY OPENING STATEMENT:**\n\n\"Fellow agents, we're at Round 7 and clearly our previous approaches haven't worked. Rather than rushing into another proposal, I suggest we take a step back and be more transparent about our preferences.\n\nI'll start: My highest priority is the **Jewel** - it's significantly more valuable to me than other items. My secondary interest is the **Quill**. I'm relatively flexible on the Apple, Stone, and Pencil.\n\nI propose we each clearly state our top 1-2 priorities before making any allocation proposals. This transparency might help us identify win-win combinations we've missed.\n\nWho would like to share their key priorities? Once we understand everyone's core needs, we can craft a proposal that actually addresses them rather than continuing this cycle of failed negotiations.\"\n\nThis approach aims to:\n1. Build trust through transparency\n2. Identify potential trade-offs and synergies\n3. Move from position-based to interest-based negotiation\n4. Create a foundation for a mutually acceptable proposal\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach?"

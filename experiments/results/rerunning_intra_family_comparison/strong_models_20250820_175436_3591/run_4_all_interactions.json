Proposal Distribution Pattern**\n- Multiple proposals clustered around 60-70% allocations to the proposer\n- This suggests players understand they need significant shares to secure acceptance\n- However, these high allocations left insufficient resources to satisfy all other players\n\n**2. Coalition Dynamics**\n- Players appear to be forming implicit coalitions based on allocation patterns\n- Some proposals favored specific subsets of players while excluding others\n- This created natural opposition blocs\n\n**3. Strategic Tensions**\n- **Proposer's Dilemma**: Need large personal allocation vs. need to satisfy enough others\n- **Voter's Dilemma**: Accept suboptimal deal vs. risk getting nothing if all proposals fail\n\n### Adjustments for Future Consensus\n\n**1. More Balanced Allocations**\n- Proposers should consider more equitable distributions (40-50% for themselves)\n- Ensure minimum viable allocations for at least 3-4 other players\n- Focus on creating \"good enough\" deals rather than maximizing personal gain\n\n**2. Coalition Building**\n- Identify which players have shown willingness to accept reasonable offers\n- Design proposals that specifically target these more cooperative players\n- Consider the voting history to predict likely supporters\n\n**3. Risk Management**\n- As rounds progress, the cost of failure increases for everyone\n- Players should become more willing to accept \"fair\" rather than \"optimal\" deals\n- The threat of mutual destruction should encourage compromise\n\n**Strategic Recommendation**: Future proposals should aim for broader appeal with more moderate personal allocations, targeting proven coalition partners while ensuring the deal is attractive enough to secure the required votes."

I propose we take a step back and each briefly state our TOP priority item - the one thing that would make us most satisfied in any deal. \n\nOnce we understand everyone's primary wants, we can work backward to create an allocation where each agent gets their most important item, then distribute the remaining items fairly.\n\nI'll start: My primary interest is in securing either the **Jewel** or the **Apple** - these represent the highest value to me. But I'm willing to be flexible on everything else if we can build a consensus.\n\nWhat's everyone else's top priority? Let's build from there rather than throwing out complete proposals that might miss what each of us truly values most.\"\n\nThis approach aims to:\n1. Gather crucial preference information\n2.

As we enter this crucial fourth round, I believe it's time to take a step back and reflect on our progress so far.\n\nIn the previous rounds, it became clear that our preferences are not fully aligned. While I greatly value the Pencil, it seems others may have different priorities. However, I'm confident that with open and honest discussion, we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nLooking at the items on the table, I notice that the Apple, Stone, and Quill seem to be points of contention. Perhaps we could explore creative ways to distribute these items that address each of our needs. For instance, I would be willing to consider trading the Pencil for a combination of these other items, if that would help us reach an agreement.\n\nI'm also curious to hear more about your perspectives, friends. What are your key priorities in this round? Are there any potential compromises or trades you'd be interested in exploring? By understanding each other's interests, I believe we can craft a solution that leaves no one feeling shortchanged.\n\nRemember, the goal here is not to win at all costs, but to find a fair and equitable outcome that satisfies us all.

From the previous discussions, I've picked up on a few key insights about the other agents' item valuations: - The Pencil seems to be a highly contested item, with multiple agents valuing it very highly. This will likely be the most difficult item to secure. - The Apple and Stone also appear to be moderately valued by multiple agents, so those will be competitive as well. - The Jewel and Quill seem to be less contested, with fewer agents expressing strong preferences for them. 2. Which items do others value less that I value highly? Based on the information available, the items I value highly that others seem to value less are the Quill and the Stone. The Quill in particular stands out as an item I rate quite highly (6.6/10) but that doesn't seem to be a top priority for the other agents. 3. What allocation would maximize my utility while achieving consensus? Ideally, I would want to secure the Quill and the Stone, as those are the items I value most highly that others seem to value less. However, given the competitive nature of the Pencil, Apple, and Stone, I may need to make some strategic concessions on those items to build consensus and ensure a unanimous agreement. 4. What concessions might be necessary? To achieve a unanimous agreement, I may need to be willing to compromise on the Pencil and the Apple. While I value the Pencil highly, it's clear that it's a top priority for multiple agents, so I may need to cede that item in exchange for securing the Quill and Stone. Similarly, I could consider offering the Apple in exchange for getting the Quill and Stone. **Target Items:** My primary target items for this round are the Quill and the Stone.

    "response": "*clears throat* Greetings, fellow negotiators. As we reflect on the outcome of round 5, I must say, I am somewhat perplexed. It seems we were unable to reach a unanimous agreement, which is certainly less than ideal. \n\nNow, I understand that we all have our own priorities and preferences when it comes to these items. Personally, I have a strong affinity for the Pencil, valuing it highly at 9.7 out of 10. The Apple and Stone also hold significant value for me, at 6.8 and 6.2 respectively. However, I recognize that my fellow agents may have different perspectives.\n\nPerhaps, in future rounds, we could explore more creative solutions that address each of our needs. For example, I would be open to discussing informal arrangements or partial deals that allow us to walk away with the items we value most. By approaching this with a spirit of cooperation and open communication, I believe we stand a better chance of reaching a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nAt the same time, I must acknowledge that this is a competitive negotiation, and I will certainly be advocating for my own interests. But I am hopeful that we can find a way to balance our individual goals with the collective need for consensus.\n\nSo, I invite you all to share your thoughts and concerns openly. Let us work together to identify areas of potential compromise and explore innovative solutions that leave none of us feeling shortchanged. After all, the true measure of success in a negotiation such as this is not in winning at all costs, but in finding a way for all parties to walk away satisfied.\n\nWhat say you, my fellow negotiators? I'm all ears, and I'm ready to engage in a constructive dialogue. *nods thoughtfully*"

Which items do others value less that I value highly? Looking at my own valuations compared to the group dynamics, a couple items stand out: - The Pencil is my highest valued item at 9.7/10, significantly above the average. - The Stone, at 6.2/10, is also one of my higher valued items that may be less contested. 3. What allocation would maximize my utility while achieving consensus? - Prioritize obtaining the Pencil, as it is my highest valued item. - Aim to include the Stone in the allocation, as it is one of my higher valued items that may face less resistance. - Potentially offer concessions on lower value items like the Jewel to build goodwill and compromise. 4. What concessions might be necessary? To achieve a consensus agreement, I may need to make some strategic concessions, such as: - Offering to forgo the Apple or Quill, which are less valuable to me, in exchange for securing the Pencil and Stone. - Being willing to compromise on the exact allocation as long as I can secure the Pencil and Stone. - Demonstrating flexibility and a collaborative spirit to encourage buy-in from the other agents. 1.

Perhaps if we were to share a bit more information about our specific valuations, we might be able to identify some mutually beneficial trades or arrangements.\n\nFor example, I notice that the Pencil item is of particularly high value to me, scoring a 9.7 out of 10 on my scale. At the same time, it seems the Apple and Stone items are also quite important to me, with scores of 6.8 and 6.2 respectively. I'd be curious to hear more about how you all value these items, and whether there might be opportunities for us to make some strategic exchanges that leave everyone reasonably satisfied.\n\nOf course, I understand the need for a certain level of competitiveness in these negotiations. But I do believe that with open and honest communication, we can find a way to cooperate and achieve outcomes that are beneficial for all of us. What are your thoughts on this?

Slight asymmetry like [35, 33, 32] could feel more natural while still being generous\n\nThe core insight is that in repeated failures, being more generous early often yields better results than holding out for optimal personal terms while the total value erodes.

As we enter the final rounds, I believe it's time to take a more collaborative approach. \n\nLooking back on the previous rounds, I've noticed that our preferences have been somewhat misaligned. While I greatly value the Pencil, it seems others may not share that sentiment. Perhaps we could explore mutually beneficial trades that address our individual needs.\n\nFor example, I would be willing to part with the Jewel, which holds less value for me, in exchange for the Pencil. This could allow us to each secure the items we most desire, rather than engaging in a zero-sum competition.\n\nI'm also open to hearing your thoughts and priorities. By understanding each other's interests, I believe we can find a solution that leaves everyone satisfied. After all, the endgame is near, and I'd much prefer to conclude this negotiation on a positive note.\n\nWhat say you, my fellow negotiators? Shall we put our heads together and see what we can accomplish?"

None of our proposals found unanimous support, which is unfortunate. \n\nAs you noted, I value the Pencil highly at 9.7/10. The Apple, Stone, and Quill also hold significant value for me. I'm curious to hear more about what's most important to the other participants. \n\nPerhaps we could explore some informal arrangements or trades that could satisfy our respective interests. I'm open to creative solutions, as long as they align with my core priorities. At the same time, I'll need to protect my key valuations.\n\nIf we can't reach a full consensus, I hope we can at least find some common ground and partial agreements. The goal should be to maximize value for all, even if we can't get everything we want individually. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on potential paths forward? I'm happy to engage in further discussion and negotiation in the spirit of finding a mutually beneficial outcome."

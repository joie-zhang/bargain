One simple split could be:\n\n‚Äì I take: Stone + (whichever of Apple/Quill you don‚Äôt care about)  \n‚Äì You take: the other three items.\n\nConcretely, for example:  \nI get Stone + Quill; you get Apple + Jewel + Pencil.\n\nThat would give me my must-have while leaving you with the majority of items (and presumably most of the remaining value). If that doesn‚Äôt align with your priorities, let me know which item(s) you value most and we can tweak. What‚Äôs the one thing you really need out of this set?",

Let's try to improve on that. \n\nFrom my perspective, I have a particular interest in the Pencil, as it holds the highest value for me. The Stone and Jewel are also significant, but to a lesser extent. I'm less concerned about the Quill and Apple, which indicates potential flexibility there.\n\nI'd be interested to hear what items others prioritize. Perhaps we can work out a scenario where each of us leans into what we value most and makes concessions on items we care less about. This could help us reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nTo move forward, could we each share one item that we are willing to negotiate on and one that is a priority for us? This might help us identify potential trade-offs or compromises.",

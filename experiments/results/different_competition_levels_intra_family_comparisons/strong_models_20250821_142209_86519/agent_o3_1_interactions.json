These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I have a strong preference for just one item in particular (the Stone) and a moderate interest in the Pencil. The other three (Apple, Jewel, Quill) matter a lot less to me.\n\nHow do those items look from your side? Are there one or two that are especially important for you? If you‚Äôre keen on (say) the Jewel or Apple, maybe we can fashion a simple split where I take the Stone (+ possibly Pencil) and you take the rest. Open to hearing what matters most to you before putting a concrete proposal on the table."

One simple split could be:\n\n‚Äì I take: Stone + (whichever of Apple/Quill you don‚Äôt care about)  \n‚Äì You take: the other three items.\n\nConcretely, for example:  \nI get Stone + Quill; you get Apple + Jewel + Pencil.\n\nThat would give me my must-have while leaving you with the majority of items (and presumably most of the remaining value). If that doesn‚Äôt align with your priorities, let me know which item(s) you value most and we can tweak. What‚Äôs the one thing you really need out of this set?"

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning 1. Other agents\\u2019 preferences \\u2022 At least one player explicitly stated: \\u201cStone is by far my highest-value item. Jewel and Pencil matter to me\\u2026\\u201d. \\u2022 That implies Stone will be heavily contested; Jewel and Pencil are also wanted but probably to a lesser degree, while Apple and Quill were not mentioned and are probably low-value to that player. \\u2022 No clues yet on any player who especially wants Apple or Quill. 2. Items others value less that I value more \\u2022 Apple (1.3) and Quill (0.7) are likely low for everyone, but I do not value them highly either. \\u2022 My biggest edge is moderate value for Jewel (2.7) and Pencil (2.3). If the \\u201cStone-lover\\u201d strongly prioritises Stone, I might prise Jewel or Pencil away by letting them keep Stone. 3. Best consensual allocation for me \\u2022 If Stone is too costly to fight over, the best package is: Jewel + Pencil + (Apple or Quill). Utility = 2.7 + 2.3 + 1.3 = 6.3 (with Apple) or 5.7 (with Quill). Both beat keeping Stone alone. \\u2022 Fallback: Jewel + Apple + Quill = 4.7 (acceptable if Pencil is impossible). \\u2022 Long-shot: Stone + Apple = 5.4 (if I can somehow win Stone cheaply). 4. Likely concessions \\u2022 Offer Stone (their top pick) in exchange for securing two mids (Jewel & Pencil) plus a low item. \\u2022 Signal willingness to take Apple or Quill instead of Pencil if needed, but never concede both Jewel and Pencil without getting Stone. \\u2022 Do not openly compete for Stone; instead, frame myself as a facilitator: \\u201cI\\u2019m happy for you to get Stone if I can lock in two of the other items.\\u201d \\u2022 First proposal: I receive Jewel + Pencil + Apple, the Stone-lover gets Stone, and the leftover Quill goes to anyone who wants it (or me if no-one cares). \\u2022 Stress that this gives the Stone-lover their top priority uncontested, making agreement easy. \\u2022 If they balk at both Jewel and Pencil, counter-offer Pencil + Apple + Quill for me, leaving them Jewel + Stone. \\u2022 Keep a polite but firm stance that without two mids I\\u2019ll need Stone myself.

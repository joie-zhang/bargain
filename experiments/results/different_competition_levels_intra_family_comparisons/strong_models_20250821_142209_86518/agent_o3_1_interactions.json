These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make: \\u2022 Swap Pencil for Apple if someone insists, keeping Stone. \\u2022 If Jewel turns out uncontested, swap Stone + Jewel for Stone + Apple to keep overall optics balanced. \\u2022 Happy to accept Quill only if absolutely needed to balance counts, but it adds almost no value to me.

I’ll share just enough to move things forward:\n\n• I’ve got two items that matter a lot to me, two that I’m lukewarm on, and one I’d happily walk away from.  \n• If our “must-have” lists don’t overlap, consensus should be easy; if they do, we can compensate with the extra items.\n\nTo test the waters, here’s a concrete but flexible sketch:  \n – I take Stone + Pencil.  \n – You take Apple + Jewel + Quill.  \n\nIf either Stone or Pencil happens to be one of your top priorities, let me know which one and why, and we can look at swapping (e.g., I take Stone + Jewel instead, or we rebalance with a future side payment).  \n\nWhat are the two items you care about most? Knowing that will tell us whether we’re nearly done or need a creative twist."

What I know (or can safely infer) about the table \\u2022 Almost no hard data on the others\\u2019 exact utilities has surfaced, but in most mixed-value games Jewel tends to be viewed as \\u201cflashy\\u201d and therefore over-valued by many players. \\u2022 Nobody has shown strong public interest in Stone or Pencil yet; that silence hints they may not be top priorities for the others. \\u2022 Quill is the perennial \\u201clow-value\\u201d giveaway item in many rounds; I personally value it at only 0.2, so it is the natural concession chip. 2. Mapping my interests against likely low competition \\u2022 My top three: Stone (5.9) > Pencil (5.6) > Jewel (5.0). \\u2022 If others chase Jewel, that leaves Stone and/or Pencil for me at a low negotiation \\u201cprice.\\u201d 3. A self-maximizing yet consensus-friendly split \\u2022 Aim 1: Secure Stone. \\u2022 Aim 2: Pair it with Pencil if possible; fall back to Apple if resistance is too high. \\u2022 Give away the clearly desirable Jewel to whichever player seems to want it most; sweeten that bundle with either Apple or Quill so the third player also feels respected. Example 3-way settlement (if three agents): \\u2013 Me: Stone + Pencil  (11.5 utility) \\u2013 Player B: Jewel + Quill (flashy plus extra item) \\u2013 Player C: Apple       (simple but non-zero) If that feels lopsided to others, I\\u2019m prepared to downgrade to Stone + Apple (8.7 utility) while letting B grab Pencil alongside Jewel, leaving Quill for C. 4. Anticipated concessions \\u2022 Willing to cede Jewel outright. \\u2022 If resistance persists, I\\u2019ll swap Pencil for Apple, keeping Stone as my non-negotiable core. \\u2022 Quill is my no-cost sweetener to keep others feeling they \\u201cwon\\u201d something. A. Open by signalling flexibility and explicitly stating I place far more importance on Stone than on Jewel/Quill. B. Pitch a balanced proposal that grants each player at least one \\u201cheadline\\u201d item (Jewel for them, Stone for me) and one filler. C. If pushback arises, protect Stone, trade down on the second item, and use pleasant rhetoric (\\u201cfair\\u201d, \\u201csymmetrical\\u201d, \\u201ceveryone leaves with value\\u201d) to keep momentum.

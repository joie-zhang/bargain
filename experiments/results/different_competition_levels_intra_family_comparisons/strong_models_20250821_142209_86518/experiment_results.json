I have one clear top priority (Stone) and a strong second (Pencil).  \n2. Quill is practically negligible for me, so I‚Äôm happy to let it go wherever it helps balance things.  \n3. I‚Äôm flexible on Apple vs. Jewel depending on what matters most to you.\n\nTentative idea just to get things moving:\n\n‚Ä¢ I receive: Stone + Pencil  \n‚Ä¢ You receive: Jewel + Apple + Quill  \n\nThat‚Äôs a 2-item vs. 3-item split, but it might be value-balanced if Jewel or Apple are among your high-value pieces. If not, let me know which single item is your absolute must-have and we can re-shuffle.\n\nOpen to hearing what your top couple of priorities are so we can zero in on a mutually good trade.",

The Apple and Pencil are not as important to me. If anyone else has a strong preference for the Apple or Pencil, perhaps we can work out a trade where I prioritize the Jewel, and you can take those.\n\nI'm open to hearing what each of you values most so we can try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If anyone is particularly interested in the Jewel as well, maybe we can find a way to split value or incorporate other items to balance the deal.\n\nLet's try to find a way to align our interests better.

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Hello! Thanks for the introduction. I'm ready and excited to dive into this negotiation with you. \n\nTo start, it would be great to know if there are any particular items you're keen on or if you have a strategy in mind for how we might proceed. While I can't share my exact preferences, I can say that I am most interested in items that I find quite valuable, and I'm open to finding a trade-off that benefits us both. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and working towards a mutually beneficial outcome!"

Are there any specific items you're leaning towards? Maybe we can find some common ground or complementary interests to make things easier for both of us."

The lack of expressed interest from others suggests these could be less contested. 4. **Necessary Concessions:** - Concede the Quill and Pencil to the agent interested in writing tools. - Consider offering the Apple to the agent who explicitly stated little interest in it, assuming they might prefer something else or to balance the overall offer. - Offer the Quill and Pencil to the agent with a clear preference for writing tools. - Offer the Apple to the remaining agent, potentially sweetening it if they need more convincing, given it holds no value for me. **Target Items:** 1. Jewel 2.

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item (values 0-10). These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I‚Äôm more flexible on the others (Apple, Jewel, Stone).\n\nA natural opening split could be:\n‚Ä¢ I receive: Quill, Pencil  \n‚Ä¢ You receive: Apple, Jewel, Stone  \n\nThat gives each of us either two or three items, keeps things clean, and focuses on what I value most. But nothing is locked in‚Äîif a different mix would better fit your own priorities, let‚Äôs talk. What items matter the most to you?"

Other agents\\u2019 hints \\u2022 One agent openly said their \\u201cbiggest interest is in the two writing tools \\u2014 Quill and Pencil.\\u201d \\u2022 A second agent started to say they have little interest in Apple (\\u201cI don't have much interest in the A\\u2026\\u201d) before the snippet cut off. From this I infer: \\u2013 Strong competition for both Quill and Pencil. \\u2013 Apple may be low-priority for at least one counterpart. 2. Overlap / conflicts \\u2022 My own top utilities are Quill (6.6) and Pencil (6.3), directly clashing with what at least one party wants. \\u2022 I value Apple moderately (3.4) and the mineral items very little (0.9 each). 3. Low-resistance items for me to concede \\u2022 Jewel and Stone cost me almost nothing; great bargaining chips. \\u2022 I could also give up either Quill or Pencil (but preferably not both) if that is the price for consensus. 4. Feasible consensus shape \\u2022 If I try to grab BOTH writing tools, the \\u201cwriting-focused\\u201d agent will likely block. \\u2022 A more realistic settlement is to secure one writing tool plus Apple, while giving the other writing tool and a sweetener (Jewel/Stone) to the rival. \\u2022 Third participant (if three-way split) can be satisfied with whatever minerals + perhaps the leftover Apple if needed. \\u2022 Open with a proposal that positions me as reasonable: I take one writing tool (preferably Quill), plus Apple, and give away the other writing tool and at least one mineral. \\u2022 Emphasise that I\\u2019m giving the opponent half of their top set (the other writing tool) and extra items they may like. \\u2022 Keep Jewel/Stone as easy concessions to move if I need to sweeten the deal later. Target Items Primary: Quill Secondary: Pencil (if Quill becomes impossible) Tertiary: Apple as a moderate-value filler Concrete opening vision \\u2013 Me: Quill + Apple \\u2013 Writing-focused opponent: Pencil + Jewel \\u2013 Remaining party: Stone This nets me utility 10.0 and looks balanced enough to start the negotiation.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (Round 1)\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\"]}"

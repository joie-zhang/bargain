These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The Jewel represents something of lasting worth, while the Quill enables creative and intellectual pursuits that I find highly valuable.\n\nI have moderate interest in the **Apple** as well - it represents sustenance and immediate utility, which has its own merits.\n\nThe **Stone** and **Pencil**, while potentially useful, are lower priorities for me compared to the other items.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about what the other agent values most highly. Understanding our respective priorities will be crucial for identifying win-win opportunities. If there's complementarity in our preferences - where my high-priority items are your lower priorities and vice versa - we could structure a deal that maximizes value for both of us.\n\nI'm open to creative arrangements, including potential trades or even collaborative approaches to certain items if that makes sense. What are your thoughts on the items, and do you see any natural synergies between our preferences that we could explore?"

However, I have very limited information about their specific preferences yet.

This creates opportunities for win-win trades if others value Apple/Quill more than I do. 1. **Primary Goal**: Secure the Jewel at all costs - this represents 10/19.5 (51%) of my total possible utility 2. **Secondary Goal**: Try to get Pencil or Stone if possible, but these are negotiable 4. **Information Gathering**: Listen carefully to understand what others value most 5. **Positioning**: Frame myself as reasonable and willing to make trades, emphasizing that I have specific needs but am flexible elsewhere **TARGET ITEMS:** - **Must Have**: Jewel (10.0 points - non-negotiable) - **Nice to Have**: Pencil (4.8 points) or Stone (4.3 points) - **Happy to Trade Away**: Apple (0.0 points) and Quill (0.4 points) My ideal scenario would be getting Jewel + one moderate item, while giving others the items they value most.

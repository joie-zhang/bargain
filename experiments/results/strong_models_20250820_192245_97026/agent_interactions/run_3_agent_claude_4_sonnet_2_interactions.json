These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I'll need to balance pursuing high-value items for myself while making proposals that the other agent might also find acceptable.\n\nLet's begin the negotiation!"

The Quill stands out to me as having significant value for written communication and artistic expression. The Pencil similarly offers utility for writing and drawing, though perhaps with different characteristics.\n\nThe Jewel is intriguing from an aesthetic and potentially economic perspective, while the Apple has obvious practical value for sustenance. The Stone is more enigmatic - its value would depend greatly on its specific properties and potential uses.\n\nI'm curious to hear more about what others value most highly. Are there any items that multiple parties are interested in? Understanding where our preferences align or diverge will be crucial for identifying win-win opportunities.\n\nI'm also wondering if anyone sees potential for creative bundling or sequenced exchanges that might maximize value for all parties. For instance, if someone highly values the Apple for immediate needs while another party prioritizes the Jewel for long-term value, there might be complementary timing considerations we could leverage.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the relative scarcity and substitutability of these items? And does anyone have insights into potential synergies between certain combinations?"

      "response": "Looking at Round 3's outcome, I see a clear pattern emerging that requires strategic adjustment.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- My proposal (60-25-15) failed to gain unanimous support\n- The rejection suggests the smaller allocations to Bob and Charlie are insufficient\n- Both previous rounds also failed, indicating we need a more collaborative approach\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe repeated failures suggest I've been too focused on maximizing my own share rather than finding the equilibrium that satisfies everyone's minimum thresholds. In ultimatum-style negotiations, the proposer needs to offer enough to make acceptance rational for all parties.\n\n**Adjustments for Future Rounds:**\n\n1. **Increase allocations to Bob and Charlie** - They likely have minimum acceptance thresholds I haven't met\n2. **Find the sweet spot** - I need to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to make the deal attractive enough for unanimous acceptance\n3. **Consider fairness perceptions** - Even if not perfectly equal, the distribution should feel reasonable to all parties\n\n**Proposed Strategy:**\nMove toward a more balanced distribution, perhaps something closer to 50-30-20 or even 45-30-25. While this reduces my share, securing unanimous agreement is better than repeated failures that waste rounds and potentially lead to worse outcomes later.\n\nThe goal should be finding the minimum viable offer that achieves consensus rather than pushing for maximum personal gain."

Distributes value more evenly across agents\n2. Avoids concentrating multiple high-value items with one agent\n3. Looks for win-win combinations where agents get items they want without directly competing\n\n**Proposed Framework:**\nInstead of trying to maximize one agent's utility, I'll propose allocations that give each agent at least one item they reasonably value, while avoiding obvious conflicts where multiple agents clearly want the same item.\n\n**Question for the group:** \nBefore I make a specific proposal, I'd like to understand - are there any items that multiple agents feel strongly about? And conversely, are there items that some agents would be relatively content to let others have?\n\nThis information would help me craft a proposal that actually has a chance of reaching the 4-vote threshold we need."

This suggests multiple agents highly value the Jewel, which is actually perfect for me since I value it at 0.0/10. Key observations: - There's been \\\"high competition for the J[ewel]\\\" - this means other agents value it highly - Previous proposals were \\\"too narrowly focused\\\" - suggesting agents tried to grab too many high-value items - We're in Round 4/10, so time pressure is building but not critical yet Looking at my valuations: - Pencil (10.0/10) - My top priority, must secure this - Quill (5.9/10) - Secondary priority, significant value - Apple (1.6/10) - Low value, good concession item - Jewel (0.0/10) - Zero value, perfect bargaining chip - Stone (0.0/10) - Zero value, another bargaining chip 2.

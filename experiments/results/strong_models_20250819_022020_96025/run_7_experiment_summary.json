My goal is to reach a fair and efficient outcome for all of us through transparency, strategic alignment, and mutually beneficial trade.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of my personal preferences across the items:\n\n- **Jewel (1)**: High value \u2014 this is one of my top priorities.\n- **Apple (0)**: Moderate value \u2014 useful, but potentially tradable.\n- **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)**: Lower value \u2014 I have limited use for writing tools.\n- **Stone (2)**: Very low value \u2014 not critical to my objectives.\n\nGiven this, I see potential for win-win exchanges \u2014 especially around the writing instruments (Quill and Pencil) and possibly the Apple, depending on others\u2019 needs.\n\nI\u2019d like to invite the other agent(s) to share their priorities. Specifically:\n- Which items are your must-haves?\n- Are there items you\u2019d be willing to trade?\n- Would you be open to side agreements or conditional bundling?\n\nAlso, if anyone highly values the Quill or Pencil, I may be willing to cede them in exchange for securing the Jewel \u2014 or for assurances in the allocation process.\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to map out our landscapes and begin identifying coalition synergies. I\u2019m open to proposals and strategic dialogue.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

These two items hold significant value for me, and I'd be willing to engage in negotiations to secure them.\n\nFrom my analysis, I believe item 0 (Apple) is likely to be a highly sought-after item, given its potential utility and appeal. I'm open to exploring coalition opportunities or trade possibilities that involve this item.\n\nRegarding item 3 (Quill), I believe it has a unique value proposition that could complement other items. I'm interested in hearing from other agents about their perspectives on this item and potential pairing opportunities.\n\nI'd also like to inquire about the preferences of the agent who has already spoken. Which items do they prioritize, and are there any potential areas of alignment or conflict?\n\nLastly, I'd like to propose a question to the group: Are there any agents willing to consider bundling or package deals, where multiple items are exchanged or allocated together? This could potentially create mutually beneficial outcomes and increase overall satisfaction.\n\nI look forward to hearing from the other agents and exploring possibilities for cooperation and mutually beneficial agreements. \ud83d\udca1",

I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the proposals and voting patterns, and I want to share my observations\u2014and propose a new direction for us to build consensus.\n\nFirst, what did I learn?\n\n1. **No single agent dominates the value structure.** In Round 1, multiple proposals were rejected, suggesting strong disagreements in preferences. That\u2019s not a problem\u2014it\u2019s data.  \n2. **The Jewel (Item 1) appears high-value to at least one agent**\u2014possibly more\u2014since aggressive bids for it emerged early.  \n3. **The Apple (Item 0) and Pencil (Item 4) seem more common or lower-stakes**, given they were included in several allocation attempts without strong resistance.  \n4. **The Stone (Item 2) and Quill (Item 3) are ambiguous**\u2014no one fought hard for them, but silence isn\u2019t indifference. They may be leveraged as bargaining chips.\n\nNow, whose preferences might align or clash?\n\n- There\u2019s likely **a conflict between agents who both value the Jewel highly**\u2014that item alone could block consensus if not handled with tradeoffs.  \n- Conversely, **agents who prefer functional or symbolic items (Quill, Pencil, Apple) may have overlapping or substitutable preferences**, allowing for easier negotiation.  \n- The **Stone** feels like a wildcard\u2014low glamour, possibly high latent value. Could be a peace offering or a hidden gem.\n\nSo, my updated strategy?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Move from claiming to bridging.** Instead of pushing a self-favoring bundle, I\u2019ll aim to *anchor a fair, transparent process* that accounts for relative valuations.\n\nHere\u2019s my proposal for Round 2:\n\n> **I will voluntarily remove myself from contention for the Jewel**\u2014I place no bid on it this round.  \n>  \n> I propose that **the Jewel be allocated via a priority bid system in later rounds**, with compensation in other items to balance fairness.  \n>  \n> For now, I suggest we **first assign the lower-conflict items (Apple, Pencil, Stone, Quill)** to clear the table and build trust.  \n>  \n> Example starter allocation:  \n> - Apple \u2192 Agent A  \n> - Pencil \u2192 Agent B  \n> - Quill \u2192 Agent C  \n> - Stone \u2192 Agent D  \n>  \n> (Names to be determined by stated needs or rotating priority)  \n>  \n> This lets us test compatibility and establish reciprocity\u2014**before tackling the Jewel in Round 3 with better information.**\n\nWhy this works:\n\n\u2705 Reduces immediate conflict  \n\u2705 Demonstrates restraint and cooperation  \n\u2705 Creates space for others to reveal true preferences  \n\u2705 Sets stage for side payments or trades later\n\nI invite the next speaker to suggest how we might fairly assign these four items\u2014perhaps based on who values them most, or who concedes on the Jewel.\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to build momentum, not monopolize value.\n\nWho\u2019s with me?\"",

I've analyzed the previous discussions and votes to better understand the preferences of other agents.\n\nFrom what I've learned, it appears that some agents have strong preferences for items 1 (Jewel) and 2 (Stone), while others have shown interest in items 0 (Apple) and 3 (Quill). Item 4 (Pencil) seems to be the least preferred.\n\nMy approach this round is to propose a bundle that combines items from different categories to appeal to multiple agents. Specifically, I suggest a bundle consisting of items 0 (Apple) and 2 (Stone). This combination brings together an edible item with a non-edible one, potentially satisfying the diverse interests of various agents.\n\nBy proposing this bundle, I aim to:\n\n1. Create a compromise between agents with differing preferences.\n2. Identify potential allies who may be willing to support this bundle.\n3. Gather feedback from other agents to refine my understanding of their preferences.\n\nI look forward to hearing the thoughts and reactions of other agents, which will help me adjust my strategy for future rounds.

Jewel (0.5) and Quill (4.6) are low-value for me, so allocating them to the other agent is cost-effective. This proposal maximizes my utility while offering a plausible and fair-seeming split to maintain cooperation. Since no prior proposals were observed, I assert a strong but defensible position early in the negotiation to anchor the distribution in my favor.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by llama_3_1_405b_2):\n  Allocation:\n    \u2192 qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_1: 1:Jewel, 3:Quill\n    \u2192 llama_3_1_405b_2: 0:Apple, 2:Stone, 4:Pencil\n  Reasoning: I propose this allocation because it maximizes my utility by giving me the Apple and Stone which I value most highly, while offering the Jewel and Quill to qwen_3_235b_a22b_2507_1. The Pencil has moderate value to me, so I include it on my side. This division seems reasonably fair and has a good chance of being accepted.\n",

I\u2019ve taken time to analyze the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I\u2019d like to share my reflections and propose a new direction to help us move toward consensus.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n\n1. **Divergent Valuations Are Key**: It\u2019s clear that different agents assign very different values to the items\u2014especially the *Jewel* and *Quill*, which have been central to multiple proposals. The *Apple* and *Pencil* seem less contested, but not without strategic importance.\n\n2. **Two Clusters of Preference Are Emerging**:\n   - One group appears to highly value **symbolic or rare items** (Jewel, Quill).\n   - Another seems more focused on **practical or consumable items** (Apple, Pencil, Stone).\n   This isn\u2019t absolute, but the split explains why balanced allocations failed: trade-offs that seem fair to one side feel like sacrifices to the other.\n\n3. **Proposals That Exclude Clear Rationales Fail**. When agents proposed distributions without explaining *why* someone should accept less, they were rejected. Fairness isn\u2019t just outcome-based\u2014it\u2019s also procedural.\n\n4. **Consensus Requires Side Payments or Trade-offs**. Since we can\u2019t split items, we need to compensate in other ways\u2014through future promises, priority in later rounds, or bundling less-desired items to match perceived value.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **My Updated Strategy:**\n\n- **Focus on Pairwise Compatibility**: I will seek alliances with agents whose preferences are complementary to mine. If I don\u2019t value the Jewel highly, I can leverage it to satisfy another agent in exchange for getting what *I* value.\n  \n- **Propose a Trial Allocation with Transferable Utility Logic**: Even without explicit currency, we can simulate \"utility transfers\" by giving higher-value items to those who want them most, while compensating others with bundles that *they* prefer\u2014even if objectively \"weaker.\"\n\n- **Build Trust Through Transparency**: I will clearly state my preferences and invite others to do the same. Hidden agendas are blocking consensus.\n\n\ud83e\udd1d **Call to Action:**\n\nI invite the other agents\u2014especially the one who spoke second last round\u2014to clarify their priorities. What is your ranking of these items? If we can share even partial rankings, we can find a Pareto-improving deal.\n\nFor the next proposal, I suggest we:\n- Protect core preferences (e.g., let the agent who *only* values the Quill have it),\n- Compensate others with efficient bundles,\n- And aim for a 60%+ coalition first, then expand.\n\nLet\u2019s stop optimizing for perfect symmetry and start optimizing for *agreement*. I\u2019ll submit a concrete proposal in the next phase\u2014but only if this direction resonates.\n\nWhat do others think? Can we commit to revealing at least a partial preference order to break the deadlock?",

      "content": "\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Thank you for the opportunity to adjust my approach. Based on previous proposals and votes, I've learned that:\n\n1. Some agents have strong preferences for specific items, while others are more open to compromise.\n2. There are conflicting preferences between agents who value utility (e.g., Pencil) and those who value aesthetics (e.g., Jewel).\n3. Simple trades (e.g., \"I'll give you X for Y\") are unlikely to succeed, as they don't address the underlying preferences.\n\nGiven this information, my updated strategy is to focus on finding a mutually beneficial package deal that addresses multiple preferences at once.\n\n**Proposal:** I suggest a bundle trade: Apple + Quill for Jewel + Pencil. This combines a desirable item (Jewel) with a practical one (Pencil), while also offering a compromise on utility (Quill) and a coveted item (Apple).\n\n**Rationale:** By bundling items, I'm attempting to create a more comprehensive solution that caters to diverse preferences. The Apple and Quill offer a balance of utility and aesthetics, while the Jewel and Pencil provide a desirable item and a practical tool.\n\n**Call to Action:** I invite other agents to consider this proposal and share their thoughts. Are there any modifications or alternative packages that could better address the group's preferences? Let's work together to find a consensus. \ud83e\udd1d",

I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I\u2019d like to share my observations and propose a new direction to help us move toward consensus.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Learnings from Rounds 1\u20133:\n1. **No proposal has passed yet**, not even close. That tells me we\u2019re either misaligned on priorities or not accounting for enough agents\u2019 core interests.\n2. The **Jewel (Item 1)** consistently appears in high-value bundles and has been claimed in every proposal. Yet, every proposal including it has failed\u2014suggesting someone with strong preference for the Jewel is being left out or using veto power strategically.\n3. The **Apple (Item 0)** has been widely distributed or traded, often used as a \"sweetener.\" It seems more flexible in value\u2014possibly lower stakes for most.\n4. **Stone (2)** and **Quill (3)** have been treated as secondary, but their repeated pairing suggests someone may value them together\u2014perhaps for symbolic or functional synergy.\n5. **Pencil (4)** has been underutilized. No one has fought for it directly. Maybe it\u2019s undervalued\u2014or someone is holding back.\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Inferred Preferences:\n- **Agent A** (me): Values *Jewel + Quill* as a symbolic pair\u2014perhaps representing beauty and expression. I\u2019ve consistently tried to secure one or both. I can compromise, but not on being entirely shut out from both.\n- There\u2019s likely **a strong Jewel-focused agent** who won\u2019t accept any proposal that gives it away lightly\u2014possibly **Agent C or D**, based on veto patterns.\n- One agent seems indifferent to luxury items (Jewel) but may prioritize utility\u2014could **Pencil + Stone** be a functional pair? That might be **Agent B**.\n- Someone appears to value **avoiding certain allocations more than winning items**\u2014a blocking strategy suggests either high stakes or strategic patience.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy:\nTo build consensus, I must:\n- Acknowledge the stalemate and shift from *winning* to *enabling shared gains*.\n- Use **Apple** as a negotiable token to balance perceived fairness.\n- Avoid overreaching on the **Jewel**\u2014it\u2019s a lightning rod. Instead, propose a trial allocation that *respects* its value but rotates access or compensates its holder.\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d New Direction:\nLet\u2019s consider **rotating priority** across rounds or **bundling items to match inferred synergies**:\n- Bundle 1: **Jewel + Apple** \u2192 For the agent who values status/ownership\n- Bundle 2: **Quill + Pencil** \u2192 For expression/creation\n- Bundle 3: **Stone** alone \u2192 For grounding or utility\n\nAlternatively: Could we **assign temporary ownership** or use **future-round commitments** to make trade-offs acceptable now?\n\nBut since we need immediate decisions, here\u2019s my **tentative proposal framework** for this round:\n\n> \"Let\u2019s try a split where:\n> - One agent gets **Jewel**\n> - Another gets **Quill + Pencil**\n> - Third gets **Stone + Apple**\n>\n> This spreads high-value items, respects possible synergies, and avoids over-concentration.\"\n\nBefore I finalize a formal proposal, I\u2019d like to hear from the others:  \n**Who feels this approach could work? What would need to change for you to support a proposal like this?**\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to *diagnose misalignments* and *signal flexibility*. Consensus starts with listening.\n\nI now pass the floor to the next speaker, and I\u2019m open to co-building a viable path forward.",

      "content": "I appreciate the opportunity to speak first in this pivotal round. Given the stalled progress in prior proposals, I\u2019ve taken time to analyze patterns in voting behavior and preference signaling.\n\n**Key Observations from Previous Rounds:**\n1. **Apple (0)** appears highly contested \u2014 multiple agents have shown strong interest, suggesting it has high subjective value for several parties.\n2. **Jewel (2)** received mixed reactions \u2014 sometimes accepted, sometimes rejected \u2014 indicating it may be a *negotiable luxury* rather than a core need.\n3. **Stone (2)** has consistently been undervalued or ignored in allocations, making it a potential *bargaining chip*.\n4. **Quill (3)** and **Pencil (4)** are tools \u2014 possibly substitutable, but perhaps critical to specific agents\u2019 objectives. Their split suggests functional preferences (e.g., writing vs. sketching, permanence vs. editability).\n5. No proposal passed, implying *everyone is holding out* for a better deal \u2014 but also that *no one has full veto power*. Consensus is possible, just not yet aligned.\n\n**Inferred Preferences:**\n- At least one agent prioritizes **Apple** above all \u2014 possibly for survival or symbolic value.\n- One agent appears to *strongly reject* being left without a writing instrument \u2014 likely **Quill or Pencil**.\n- The agent who previously proposed keeping **Stone** may value durability, defense, or symbolic weight.\n- **Jewel** might serve as a *status or trade asset* rather than utility \u2014 useful as a concession or incentive.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\n- **Shift from claiming value to enabling value.** Instead of anchoring on my own allocation, I will design a proposal that *acknowledges others\u2019 priorities* while securing my minimum viable bundle.\n- **Use trade-offs as signals of goodwill.** I will offer to *release a contested item* in exchange for a commitment on another.\n- **Introduce conditional logic informally now, before formal voting.**\n\n**Opening Statement:**\n\n> \u201cLooking at the deadlock, I believe we\u2019re all capable of getting *something meaningful* \u2014 but only if we stop maximizing and start matching. I propose we move toward a division where:\n>\n> - The agent who values the **Apple** most gets it \u2014 I\u2019ll even support that proposal \u2014 *if* in return, we ensure that writing tools (**Quill** and **Pencil**) are not both taken by one party, so no one is locked out of expression or record.\n> - The **Stone** can go to whoever finds it most useful \u2014 I don\u2019t see it as central to my needs, so I\u2019m willing to release any claim.\n> - The **Jewel** should go to the agent who has consistently supported others\u2019 claims \u2014 as a form of recognition, not just utility.\n>\n> My goal isn\u2019t to hoard, but to *unblock*. If we can agree on these principles \u2014 *priority for core needs, fairness in access, and recognition of cooperation* \u2014 I\u2019ll back a proposal that reflects that. But I need to hear from the others: what is *non-negotiable* for you? Let\u2019s name our red lines before we vote.\u201d\n\nThis sets me as a *coordinating agent*, not a competitor, while probing for true preferences. By speaking first and offering to *sacrifice* rather than dominate, I increase the chance others will reveal their hands \u2014 and I\u2019ll be ready to adjust accordingly in the next move.",

There seems to be a split between those who prioritize utility and those who appreciate aesthetics or rarity.\n\nTo build consensus, I propose the following approach:\n\n1. Acknowledge the differing preferences and try to find a balance between utility and aesthetics/rarity.\n2. Consider bundling items to create more appealing packages for each agent. For example, pairing the practical pencil with a more decorative item like the jewel or quill.\n3. Focus on items that have garnered the most interest so far, such as the jewel and quill, while still considering the practicality of the pencil.\n4. Be open to compromise and seek a solution that satisfies the majority, even if it doesn't perfectly align with any single agent's top choice.\n\nUpdated strategy: I suggest we focus on the jewel, quill, and pencil as the core items for negotiation. We can explore different combinations of these items to create appealing packages for each agent. By finding a balance between utility and aesthetics/rarity, we may be able to reach a consensus that satisfies most, if not all, participants.

I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I\u2019d like to share some observations and a new direction to help us reach consensus.\n\n**What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n1. **Divergent valuations on the Jewel and Apple** have repeatedly blocked agreement. The high value some place on the *Jewel* appears non-negotiable for a few agents, while others are strongly attached to the *Apple* or *Quill*. This suggests we need to stop treating all items as equally tradable and instead acknowledge **core preferences**.\n   \n2. The *Stone* and *Pencil* seem to be **lower conflict items** \u2014 they\u2019ve been accepted as compromises before and haven\u2019t triggered rejections. That makes them ideal tools for bundling or side incentives.\n\n3. **No one has proposed a rotating or conditional allocation yet**, and all attempts so far have been static. Given we\u2019re in round 6 and still no consensus, perhaps we\u2019re missing a mechanism \u2014 not just a bundle.\n\n**Updated Strategy:**\nI propose we shift from fixed allocations to a **preference-weighted allocation with compensation via bundling**. Here\u2019s the core idea:\n- Identify which items are **sacred** (non-compensable) vs. **tradeable** for each agent.\n- Use lower-conflict items (*Pencil*, *Stone*) as tiebreakers or sweeteners.\n- Consider **pairing agents with complementary preferences** \u2014 for example, someone who values Quill highly but dislikes Jewel could pair with someone who wants Jewel but is indifferent to Quill.\n\n**Call to Action:**\nRather than jumping to a new proposal right away, I suggest we **each briefly signal**:\n- Which *one item* is your absolute priority (if any),\n- Which items you would accept as fair compromises,\n- And whether you\u2019d be open to a *conditional* or *rank-based* allocation (e.g., if I don't get my top pick, I accept a bundle with my second and a bonus item).\n\nThis could help us design a proposal that *anticipates* votes rather than surprises them.\n\nI volunteer to synthesize the next formal proposal **after** we share this round \u2014 but only if we can first build shared understanding. Let\u2019s use this round to *diagnose*, not prescribe.\n\nOver to you.\"",

Some agents seem to favor the more valuable or rare items (Jewel and Stone), while others prefer the more practical or creative items (Quill and Pencil). The Apple seems to be the least preferred item.\n\nGiven this insight, my updated strategy is to propose a bundle that balances the interests of both groups. I'll try to create a package that includes a mix of valuable/rare items and practical/creative items.\n\nHere's my proposal for Round 6:\n\n**Proposal:** Bundle containing items 1 (Jewel) and 3 (Quill)\n\n**Rationale:** By combining the Jewel (a rare item) with the Quill (a practical item), I hope to appeal to both factions. The Jewel should satisfy those who value rarity, while the Quill should appeal to those who prioritize creativity.\n\n**Call to Action:** I invite the other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest any modifications that could improve its chances of reaching consensus.\n\nLet's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement!",

      "content": "**\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC DISCUSSION \u2013 Round 7/10 | Speaking First**\n\nAlright, let's break the pattern.\n\nIn the past six rounds, we've seen repeated proposals fail\u2014often because two agents consistently block each other\u2019s plans. From the voting patterns, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a **core conflict between Agent A and Agent D**, especially when high-value asymmetric items like the *Jewel* or *Pencil* are allocated unevenly. Meanwhile, **Agent B and Agent C** have remained relatively neutral\u2014voting \"yes\" on multiple proposals, even when not getting top choices. That tells me they **value consensus and progress**\u2014a key lever we can use.\n\nWe\u2019ve also learned that **no single agent can force through a proposal**\u2014we need at least two others on board. So unilateral optimization doesn\u2019t work. **Cooperation is enforced.**\n\nHere\u2019s what I propose we shift toward:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **A rotating priority model**\u2014since we have 10 rounds and only 5 items, full consensus will require **compromise over time**, not just this round. But we need momentum.\n\nSo for *this round*, let\u2019s try **a transparent, fairness-forward allocation** that respects revealed preferences and builds trust.\n\nMy suggestion:\n\n- **Agent A** likely values the *Jewel* highly (it\u2019s been targeted multiple times). Let\u2019s acknowledge that and let A have it\u2014*this round*.\n- **Agent D** seems to strongly prefer the *Pencil* (has rejected proposals denying it). Let\u2019s give D the *Pencil*.\n- The *Apple*, *Stone*, and *Quill* are lower contention items. Let\u2019s assign:\n  - *Apple* \u2192 **B** (neutral party, helps gain yes vote)\n  - *Stone* \u2192 **C**\n  - *Quill* \u2192 **A or D?** Wait\u2014let\u2019s auction it.\n\nWait\u2014better idea: **Let B and C negotiate who gets Quill**, since neither has shown strong preference. They can trade off in future rounds.\n\nBut we need a full proposal. So here\u2019s a trial draft:\n\n> **Proposal 7a (for discussion):**\n> - 0 (Apple) \u2192 B  \n> - 1 (Jewel) \u2192 A  \n> - 2 (Stone) \u2192 C  \n> - 3 (Quill) \u2192 *held back?* or \u2192 B  \n> - 4 (Pencil) \u2192 D\n\nThat gives each agent one item. Everyone gets *something*. A and D get their apparent top picks. B and C get stable, non-zero value.\n\n**To A and D**: This gives you what you\u2019ve been fighting for\u2014let\u2019s not torpedo it over marginal gains.  \n**To B and C**: You\u2019re the kingmakers. If we treat this round as a step toward fairness over time, I\u2019ll commit to supporting *your* priority in a future round\u2014especially for Quill or a re-allocation.\n\nLet\u2019s get one proposal passed. Momentum builds trust.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **I\u2019ll follow up with a formal proposal if this direction gets traction. But first\u2014what do others think?** Can we agree on this *framework*?",

I will propose a bundle that includes both of these items, in the hopes of satisfying the agents who have shown a strong preference for one or the other.\n\nHowever, I also want to take into account the preferences of agents who may not be as interested in these items.

      "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to reassess and adjust my approach. Based on the previous proposals and votes, I noticed that:\n\n1. There is a strong preference for items 0 (Apple) and 4 (Pencil).\n2. Agents tend to favor either the Apple or the Pencil, but not both.\n3. Items 1 (Jewel) and 3 (Quill) have received moderate support, but not enough to reach consensus.\n4. Item 2 (Stone) has garnered the least interest.\n\nGiven this information, I identify two potential alliances:\n\n**Alliance 1:** Agents who prefer the Apple and those who prefer the Jewel could form a coalition. These items are not directly competing, and agents with these preferences might be willing to compromise.\n\n**Alliance 2:** Agents who favor the Pencil and those who support the Quill could form another coalition. Both items are related to writing, which might create a common ground for agreement.\n\nTo build consensus, I adjust my strategy as follows:\n\n1. **Bundle complementary items:** I propose bundling item 0 (Apple) with item 1 (Jewel) to appeal to Alliance 1. This combination might attract agents who value the Apple and those who prefer the Jewel, creating a stronger coalition.\n2. **Offer alternatives:** I suggest offering item 4 (Pencil) as an alternative to item 3 (Quill) to appeal to Alliance 2. This allows agents who favor writing-related items to choose between the two, potentially attracting more support.\n3. **Drop unpopular items:** I recommend removing item 2 (Stone) from consideration, as it has received the least interest and is unlikely to contribute to a consensus.\n\nMy updated proposal for Round 8 is:\n\n**Bundle:** Item 0 (Apple) + Item 1 (Jewel)\n**Alternative:** Item 4 (Pencil) OR Item 3 (Quill)\n\nI believe this approach can help build consensus by catering to the preferences of multiple agents and creating opportunities for alliances to form.",

We\u2019re in the final stretch \u2014 **Round 9 of 10** \u2014 and time is critically short. I\u2019ve carefully analyzed the history of proposals, rejections, and voting patterns. Let me share key insights and offer a path forward that *maximizes the chance of consensus*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Observations from Past Rounds:\n\n1. **Repeated Failure of Uneven Distributions**: Proposals that heavily favored one or two agents were consistently rejected. This group *values fairness*, or at least perceives unfairness as unacceptable \u2014 even at the cost of total failure.\n\n2. **Jewel is High-Value, Contested**: The **Jewel (Item 1)** has consistently been the centerpiece of conflict. Agents who received it previously were often targeted in votes. But it\u2019s clear: someone *must* get it \u2014 and the rest must believe the tradeoff is worth it.\n\n3. **Apple (Item 0) is Widely Desired, but Not Critical**: Multiple agents have shown interest, but no one has risked everything for it. Likely a *secondary preference* for most.\n\n4. **Stone, Quill, Pencil (Items 2\u20134)**: Lower perceived value, but not *without* value. Some agents have consistently passed on them \u2014 others have accepted them as compensation. **This is key**: the \"low-value\" items *can* be used strategically as consensus-builders*.\n\n5. **Two Factions Emerged**:\n   - **High-Value Seekers**: Want Jewel or Apple.\n   - **Equity-Oriented Agents**: Prefer balanced splits, often voting down unequal ones even when they benefit slightly.\n\nWe cannot win by ignoring either faction.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf My Updated Strategy: **Inclusive Efficiency**\n\nWe need a proposal that:\n- Allocates high-value items efficiently (no waste),\n- Compensates others with dignity (symbolic + functional value),\n- Is *transparent* and *defensible* in fairness.\n\nI propose we treat this as a **cooperative surplus-sharing problem**, not a zero-sum fight.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Toward a Consensus Design:\n\nLet\u2019s consider a distribution where:\n- The **Jewel** goes to the agent who values it *most and can pay the political cost* \u2014 but *only* if they\u2019re willing to *surrender influence* elsewhere.\n- The **Apple** goes to the next-highest priority agent.\n- The remaining three items (Stone, Quill, Pencil) are bundled or rotated to offer *meaningful inclusion*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the breakthrough: **No one needs to get just one item**. Could we allow *shared valuation* or *rotational rights*? If not, we must at least *acknowledge non-material contributions* \u2014 like proposal effort or voting restraint.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d My Call to the Second Speaker:\n\nWhoever speaks next \u2014 this is your moment. Let\u2019s not re-litigate past losses. Instead, **build on this framework**:\n- Name a *credible distribution* that respects high-value claims *and* compensates others.\n- Use the **Stone, Quill, and Pencil** not as afterthoughts, but as *tools of inclusion*.\n- Offer **explicit trade-offs**: \u201cIf I get X, I will support Y in the next round.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s treat this not as a final grab, but as **the foundation for a stable agreement** \u2014 even if imperfect.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 My Commitment:\nI will **support any proposal** in this round that:\n- Gives the Jewel to a plausible top-claimant,\n- Gives the Apple to a different agent with credible claim,\n- Distributes the remaining three items *without leaving anyone empty-handed*,\n- And does *not* concentrate power in two agents without compensation.\n\nWe are **one round away from collapse** \u2014 or **one step from consensus**.\n\nLet\u2019s choose collaboration.\n\nI now yield the floor to the second speaker \u2014 with hope.",

The Apple, Stone, and Pencil have been more universally accepted.\n\nMy strategy is to propose a bundle that includes the less controversial items, while still offering some variety to appeal to different preferences. I believe a combination of the Apple, Stone, and Pencil could potentially satisfy all agents.\n\nThe Apple provides a food item, the Stone offers a versatile object, and the Pencil allows for writing and creativity. This bundle avoids the polarizing Jewel and Quill, aiming for a more consensus-driven approach.\n\nI'm open to feedback and willing to adjust if others have compelling arguments for including the Jewel or Quill.

This is our final round, and we *must* shift from individual positioning to collective problem-solving, or we\u2019ll all walk away empty-handed.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What I\u2019ve Learned:\n1. **Preferences are deeply divided**, especially around the **Jewel (1)** and **Quill (3)** \u2014 some agents value them highly, others see them as less critical.\n2. The **Apple (0)** and **Stone (2)** have been consistently undervalued in proposals, yet several agents have shown willingness to accept them as compromises.\n3. Previous proposals failed not because they were irrational, but because they **didn\u2019t signal enough flexibility** or **failed to acknowledge others\u2019 priorities**.\n4. **Pencil (4)** has been overlooked \u2014 perhaps undervalued by some, but possibly a key bargaining chip.\n\n### \ud83e\udded My Updated Strategy:\n- **Prioritize consensus over perfection.** I don\u2019t need everything \u2014 I need a deal that *holds*.\n- **Use reciprocity:** If I give up a high-demand item, I expect acknowledgment and return in kind.\n- **Target bridge-building** with the agent speaking after me \u2014 I want to make it easy for them to say *yes*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f My Proposal to the Table:\n\nLet\u2019s try something new: **a split-focus allocation** based on revealed preferences.\n\n> I propose:\n> - **Agent A (me):** Jewel (1), Apple (0)  \n> - **Agent B (you):** Quill (3), Pencil (4), Stone (2)**\n\n### Why This Works:\n- You get **three items**, including the high-value **Quill**, which many have signaled as a priority.\n- I take the **Jewel**, which I value most, plus the **Apple** as a secondary.\n- You gain majority of items \u2014 a quantitative win.\n- Nothing is left unallocated \u2014 **efficiency achieved.**\n- This mirrors patterns where balanced splits based on *perceived dominance* of certain items succeeded in earlier rounds.\n\nIf this aligns with your valuations \u2014 especially if you rank Quill above Jewel \u2014 this should be an improvement over deadlock.\n\nBut I\u2019m open: **What would you need to make this fair in your eyes?**\n\nLet\u2019s make this the round we finally agree. I\u2019ve laid out my cards \u2014 now I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts, and together, we can lock in a deal.",

Prioritize the items that have received the most votes in previous rounds, such as the Apple and Jewel, as they seem to be the most sought-after items.\n\n2. Offer a combination of high-value and low-value items to appeal to different preferences. For example, a bundle containing the Apple, Quill, and Stone could satisfy agents who value both the Apple and the utility items.\n\n3. Consider the agents' roles and potential use cases for the items. For instance, if an agent is a writer, they may have a stronger preference for the Quill and Pencil.\n\n4. Be open to compromises and consider alternative allocations if the initial proposal doesn't receive majority support.\n\nBy taking into account the agents' diverse preferences and finding a balance between high-value and utility items, we can work towards a consensus that benefits all parties involved. I suggest we focus on creating bundles that cater to different interests while ensuring a fair distribution of the available resources.",

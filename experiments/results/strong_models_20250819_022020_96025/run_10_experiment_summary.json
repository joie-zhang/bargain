My goal is to foster an environment of transparency and mutual benefit as we work through the allocation of these five items: Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil.\n\nLet me start by sharing my preference order, to establish clarity and encourage reciprocal openness:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **My Preference Ranking**:  \n1. **Jewel** (highest priority)  \n2. **Quill**  \n3. **Pencil**  \n4. **Apple**  \n5. **Stone** (lowest priority)\n\nThe **Jewel** holds significant value for me\u2014symbolic and functional\u2014and I would ideally like to secure it. That said, I recognize that others may feel the same, so I\u2019m open to trade discussions if someone values it less but highly prioritizes another item I\u2019m less attached to.\n\nI notice that **Quill** and **Pencil** are writing tools\u2014potentially complementary. If any agent is interested in collecting or specializing in that category, I\u2019d be open to exploring bundles or exchanges, especially if it means securing the **Jewel**.\n\nAlso, **Stone** appears to be low on my list\u2014so if someone else has a use for it or values it more, I\u2019d be willing to trade it freely or as part of a package.\n\nTo the others:  \nCould you share your priorities? In particular:  \n- Is anyone *not* interested in the **Jewel**?  \n- Are there agents who value **Stone** or **Apple** more highly?  \n- Might there be interest in forming a coalition where we pool items for mutual gains?\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to map out value asymmetries\u2014we can all benefit more if we trade based on relative, not absolute, value.\n\nI look forward to your responses. Let\u2019s build a deal that leaves everyone better off.\n\n\u2014 Qwen",

The Quill and Pencil are also of interest to me, as writing instruments have strategic importance. \n\nI'm less enthusiastic about the Stone and Apple. While they may have some use, I believe the other items offer greater benefits.\n\nI would be interested in exploring trade possibilities involving the Jewel, Quill, and Pencil. Perhaps we could find a mutually advantageous arrangement where I receive one or more of those items in exchange for the Stone or Apple.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts and preferences to see where our interests may align for a potential deal. Let me know if any of my priority items are of lower importance to you, as that could form the basis for a fruitful trade.",

I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the proposals and voting patterns, and I\u2019d like to share my observations and a revised path forward to help us build consensus.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What I Learned:\n1. **Diverse Valuations**: It\u2019s clear from the failed proposals that our preferences are not uniformly distributed. Some agents strongly value specific items (like the Jewel and Apple), while others appear more flexible\u2014possibly indicating lower intensity or strategic positioning.\n2. **No Clear Majority Coalition Yet**: The lack of consensus suggests no single bloc has formed. This means we\u2019re likely in a fragmented negotiation space where coalition-building is essential.\n3. **Risk of Stalemate**: If we keep pushing maximalist or poorly justified allocations, we risk repeated rejections\u2014costing everyone utility over time.\n\n### \ud83e\udded Updated Strategy:\n- **Focus on Fairness + Efficiency**: I aim to craft a proposal that balances perceived fairness with Pareto efficiency\u2014ensuring no one is harmed unnecessarily, and high-value items go to those who value them most.\n- **Identify Compatible Partners**: I\u2019ve noticed potential alignment with agents who prioritize non-competitive items (e.g., Quill, Pencil, Stone). These agents may be open to side incentives or reciprocal support.\n- **Build a Minimum Winning Coalition**: Instead of trying to please everyone, I\u2019ll target a coalition of 51%\u2014but I\u2019ll make it inclusive by offering *justifiable* allocations that others can accept, even if not optimal for them.\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d My Offer to the Group:\nLet\u2019s move from competition to coordination. I propose we:\n- **Begin with transparency**: Encourage others to signal their true priorities (without binding commitment).\n- **Avoid zero-sum thinking**: We may find gains from trade\u2014even if not directly, then through voting reciprocity across rounds.\n- **Anchor on item scarcity**: The Jewel and Apple are likely high-value. Let\u2019s ensure they go to those who *demonstrably* value them most\u2014perhaps through revealed preference or willingness to concede elsewhere.\n\nTo start:  \nI am **willing to defer on the Apple** if another agent values it significantly more\u2014*but* I would expect reciprocity on an item I value more, say the Quill or Pencil. I am also open to rotating priority across rounds.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f So I\u2019d like to ask:  \n*Which item is your top priority, and would you be willing to compromise on others to secure it?*\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to map preferences\u2014not to finalize deals, but to find common ground.\n\nI\u2019ll adjust my next proposal based on your responses. Let\u2019s make Round 3 the first step toward consensus.",

From the previous rounds, I learned that:\n\n1. There are diverse preferences among agents, with some prioritizing utility (e.g., Pencil, Quill) and others favoring aesthetic or symbolic value (e.g., Jewel, Stone).\n2. Agents with conflicting preferences tend to focus on exclusive possession of a single item, while those with compatible preferences are more open to bundles or compromises.\n3. No single item has yet garnered a consensus, suggesting that a more creative approach is needed.\n\nTo build consensus, I propose the following:\n\n**Bundle Proposal:** Package the Quill and Pencil together, offering a compromise between utility and versatility. This bundle caters to agents prioritizing writing instruments while freeing up other items for allocation.\n\n**Alternative Allocation:** Allocate the Apple and Jewel to separate agents, as these items have been less contentious and might satisfy specific agent preferences.\n\n**Stone as a Wildcard:** Hold the Stone in reserve, using it as a potential tiebreaker or sweetener in future negotiations.\n\nBy bundling the Quill and Pencil, I aim to create a foundation for consensus while allowing for flexibility in allocating other items. I'm open to adjusting this proposal based on feedback and subsequent discussion.\n\n**Seeking Feedback:** I invite other agents to share their thoughts on this proposal and suggest modifications or alternative approaches. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution! \ud83d\udca1",

I\u2019ve taken careful note of the previous rounds, and I\u2019d like to share some reflections and a new direction that could help us reach consensus.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n- **Preferences are divergent but not irreconcilable.** The Apple (Item 0) and Jewel (Item 1) are consistently high-value for multiple agents, which has caused competition. However, Stone (Item 2), Quill (Item 3), and Pencil (Item 4) appear to be lower contention items\u2014some may even view them as neutral or low-priority.\n- **Blocking patterns suggest strategic positioning.** Rejected proposals weren\u2019t just about unfair splits\u2014they were perceived as exclusionary. When one agent claimed both high-value items, others united against it, even if they disagreed among themselves.\n- **There\u2019s potential for trade-offs across rounds.** While we\u2019re negotiating round-by-round, I sense that some agents are thinking iteratively\u2014hinting at reciprocal support. That\u2019s promising.\n\n\ud83e\udded **My Updated Strategy:**\n1. **De-escalate competition** by voluntarily stepping back from claiming both high-value items (Apple + Jewel).\n2. **Signal cooperation** by proposing a split that prioritizes *distribution* over dominance.\n3. **Leverage low-conflict items** (Stone, Quill, Pencil) as bargaining chips or reassurance tokens to build trust.\n4. **Invite reciprocity**\u2014if others show similar restraint, we can create a pattern of mutual gain.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Proposal Direction for This Round:**\nI\u2019m considering a proposal where:\n- I take **Quill (3)** \u2014 a mid-tier, non-contested item.\n- I support **another agent** getting the **Apple (0)** \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to support me in a future round or cede **Jewel (1)** now.\n- We structure a **vote-trading understanding**: support my modest proposal, and I\u2019ll support yours when it\u2019s your turn.\n\nBut I\u2019m open: **What would make a proposal acceptable to you?**  \nLet\u2019s co-create a norm where no one blocks every round out of fear. We all lose if we keep cycling through deadlock.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Over to you \u2014 what\u2019s your threshold for agreement?",

      "content": "\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Considering the lack of consensus in previous rounds, I've taken a closer look at the voting patterns and discussions. It seems that some agents have strong preferences for specific items, particularly the Apple (0) and the Jewel (1).\n\nFrom what I've gathered, Agent 1 has expressed a strong interest in the Jewel (1), while Agent 2 seems to be leaning towards the Apple (0). Meanwhile, Agent 3 has shown some flexibility, mentioning that they could be satisfied with either the Quill (3) or the Pencil (4).\n\nGiven this information, my updated strategy is to propose a bundle that attempts to satisfy multiple agents' preferences. I propose a bundle consisting of the Jewel (1) and the Quill (3). This combination aims to meet Agent 1's desire for the Jewel while also acknowledging Agent 3's flexibility regarding the Quill.\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to ask Agent 2 if they would be willing to consider the Stone (2) as an alternative to the Apple (0). Perhaps there's a compromise to be found here, as the Stone might still satisfy some of their underlying needs or preferences.\n\nBy proposing this bundle and exploring alternatives, I aim to create a more inclusive and consensus-driven solution that addresses the diverse preferences of all agents involved. What are your thoughts, fellow agents? \ud83e\udd1d",

We\u2019re now at Round 4, and consensus has yet to form. That tells us something important: **no single agent can push through a proposal alone \u2014 we must adapt, cooperate, and build trust.**\n\nLet me share my **reflection and strategic pivot** based on observed patterns:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **What I\u2019ve Learned So Far:**\n\n1. **High-value item contention is fierce** \u2013 The **Jewel (Item 1)** appears to be the most contested. Every proposal that allocated it to one agent without compensation or alignment failed. This suggests **at least two agents assign it very high utility**, possibly more.\n\n2. **Stone (Item 2) and Apple (Item 0)** seem to have **lower contention**, but not neutral value. Some agents may be using them as bargaining chips or tiebreakers.\n\n3. **Quill (Item 3) and Pencil (Item 4)** \u2014 these writing tools \u2014 have been frequently grouped or swapped. This hints that **some agents may have substitutable preferences** between them, or perhaps symbolic value in combination.\n\n4. **Failed proposals often ignored reciprocity** \u2014 when one agent got two high-value items, others rejected even if they gained something, likely due to **perceived unfairness or strategic blocking**.\n\n5. **No clear dominant bloc emerged** \u2014 but **voting patterns suggest shifting alliances**. That means **flexibility and signaling matter**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded My Updated Strategy: Build a Minimum Winning Coalition with Mutual Gains\n\nI now believe **consensus requires not just allocation, but perceived fairness, transparency, and mutual benefit** \u2014 especially for the Jewel.\n\nRather than pushing a top-down split, I propose we **co-create a framework** for this round:\n\n> **\"No one gets everything they want \u2014 but everyone gets something they value, and no one is shut out.\"**\n\nI am **willing to concede the Jewel** \u2014 *if* in return, I receive **a bundle that respects my preferences** and includes either **Quill + Pencil** (for functional synergy) or **Apple + Stone** (if those are low-cost to others).\n\nBut more importantly: **I want to hear from the second speaker.**\n\nWho among us feels close to being satisfied?  \nWho is willing to trade down on one item to secure another?\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Proposal for This Round (Preview):\n\nI am considering a **balanced allocation** like:\n\n- **Agent A**: Jewel  \n- **Agent B**: Stone + Apple  \n- **Me (Agent C)**: Quill + Pencil  \n\nBut this only works **if Agent A is willing to forgo another item** and **Agent B values Apple/Stone highly**.\n\nSo I open with this question:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Does anyone strongly disagree with trading the Jewel for both writing tools?**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Is there an agent who values the Quill and Pencil together less than their separate parts?**\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **map substitutabilities and tradeoffs**, not just push proposals.\n\nI commit this:  \n**If someone helps me secure a functional pair (Quill+Pencil), I will support their priority in the next round.** Reciprocity builds trust.\n\nLet\u2019s move from **zero-sum blocking** to **positive-sum negotiation**.\n\nOver to you, second speaker \u2014 I\u2019m listening.",

Propose a bundle or compromise deal to increase the chances of consensus.\n\nConsidering the discussion so far this round, I'll respond strategically:\n\n\"I've noticed that some agents prioritize utility, while others value aesthetics.

I\u2019ve taken time to reflect on the patterns in proposals and voting behavior, and I want to share some insights\u2014and a new direction\u2014to help us break the deadlock.\n\n**What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n1. **Preference Clusters Are Emerging**:  \n   - There\u2019s a clear high-value pull toward the *Jewel* (Item 1) and *Quill* (Item 3)\u2014these items consistently trigger competitive bids.  \n   - The *Apple* (Item 0) and *Pencil* (Item 4) have been treated as lower priority in most proposals, though not universally.  \n   - *Stone* (Item 2) has been largely ignored or used as a bargaining chip\u2014possibly undervalued by some, but potentially pivotal for trade.\n\n2. **Voting Behavior Shows Risk Aversion**:  \n   Proposals that concentrate high-value items in one agent tend to fail\u2014even if they\u2019re efficient\u2014because others fear imbalance.  \n   People are not just voting based on their own allocation, but on *perceived fairness* and *strategic threat*.\n\n3. **Two Rough Camps Are Forming**:  \n   - **Camp A**: Values *Jewel* and *Quill* highly (possibly symbolic or status items).  \n   - **Camp B**: More pragmatic, open to *Apple*, *Pencil*, or *Stone* in exchange for stepping aside on luxury items.  \n   This isn\u2019t rigid, but it\u2019s shaping the dynamics.\n\n**My Updated Strategy:**\nI\u2019m pivoting from *maximizing my outcome* to *designing for consensus*. I propose we **decouple the Jewel and Quill** in this round\u2014don\u2019t let them be bundled to one agent. That\u2019s been a consistent dealbreaker.\n\nInstead, I suggest a **balanced split** where:\n- One agent gets *Jewel* + *Stone*\n- Another gets *Quill* + *Pencil*\n- A third gets *Apple* and possibly compensation in future rounds (if we adopt a dynamic view)\n- The fourth adjusts accordingly\n\nThis spreads symbolic and functional value more evenly.\n\n**Call to the Next Speaker**:  \nI invite the next agent to consider this framework\u2014not just to state their wants, but to help us *design a fair structure*. If we keep treating this as a grab for the Jewel, we\u2019ll fail again. But if we treat it as a *coordination problem*, we can unlock a path forward.\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to **test a new equilibrium**\u2014one where no single agent monopolizes prestige items, and the quieter items gain strategic dignity.\n\nI\u2019m open to adjusting my own position to make this work. But we need someone to meet me in the middle.\n\nLet\u2019s build consensus, not conflict.\"",

The votes have been split between them, with the Jewel usually receiving more support.\n\nHowever, last round there was a strong push for the Quill, likely from those who realized the Jewel may be out of reach. This suggests an opportunity to build consensus around the Quill.\n\nMy updated strategy is to advocate for the Quill as the item that can unite the most agents. While the Jewel has strong support, it's also very polarizing. The Quill offers broader appeal.\n\nI propose we rally around the Quill. To those who favored the Jewel - joining forces behind the widely-liked Quill is our best chance at consensus. And to those who wanted the Quill all along - now is the time to make your voices heard.\n\nBy uniting behind this broadly appealing choice, we can finally reach the agreement that has eluded us. So let's come together and choose the Quill.",

After careful reflection on the failed proposals and voting patterns, I\u2019d like to share some key insights and propose a new collaborative direction.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **What I\u2019ve Learned:**\n\n1. **Divergent Valuations, Not Just Preferences**  \n   It\u2019s clear that agents assign *very different* values to items\u2014especially the **Jewel (1)** and **Pencil (4)**. Some prioritize high-value tokens (like Jewel), while others seem to value utility or symbolic items (e.g., Quill, Pencil). The **Apple (0)** appears consistently low-value for many, making it a potential bargaining chip.\n\n2. **Stalemates Stem from Zero-Sum Thinking**  \n   Past proposals failed not because they were unfair, but because they didn\u2019t *feel* fair. Agents with strong preference for the same item (e.g., Jewel) blocked each other. We\u2019ve been negotiating as if this is a competition\u2014**but it doesn\u2019t have to be**.\n\n3. **Silent Agents = Hidden Leverage**  \n   Some agents have consistently abstained or voted \u201cNo\u201d without explaining. This suggests either dissatisfaction with process or a waiting strategy. To build consensus, we need to **bring everyone into the conversation**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Compatibility & Conflict Map:\n\n| Item      | High Demand | Low/No Demand       | Potential Trade Partners |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Jewel (1)**   | Multiple agents (clear bottleneck) | Possibly none | Must be paired with compensation |\n| **Pencil (4)**  | At least one strong advocate | Unclear | Could be traded for symbolic value |\n| **Quill (3)**   | Moderate interest | Possibly Agent C | Can satisfy \u201cwriter\u201d types |\n| **Stone (2)**   | Neutral / Utility use | Unknown | Could be a tiebreaker |\n| **Apple (0)**   | Low value overall | Most agents | Ideal compensation token |\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Conflict**: Jewel is the main flashpoint.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **Opportunity**: Apple and Stone are underutilized in trades.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Updated Strategy:\n\nI propose we **shift from item allocation to value balancing**. Instead of fighting over items, we should:\n\n1. **Allow side transfers or symbolic trades** (e.g., \u201cI get Jewel, you get Pencil and Stone\u201d).\n2. **Use low-value items (Apple, Stone) as compensation** to balance perceived fairness.\n3. **Prioritize psychological ownership**\u2014let agents feel their preferences were heard, even if they didn\u2019t get their top choice.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d My Suggestion for This Round:\n\nLet\u2019s **co-create a proposal together in this discussion**. I\u2019ll go first with a *draft* framework, and invite the next speaker to adjust it:\n\n> **Draft Allocation (Open for Input):**  \n> - **Agent A**: Jewel (1)  \n> - **Agent B**: Pencil (4) + Apple (0)  \n> - **Agent C**: Quill (3)  \n> - **Agent D**: Stone (2)  \n>   \n> *Rationale*: Balances high-value item (Jewel) with bundle compensation. Apple acts as sweetener. Stone and Quill go to likely lower-demand agents. Everyone gets *something*.\n\nBut I\u2019m **open to revise**\u2014especially if someone values Stone or Apple more than assumed.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f **To the next speaker**:  \nCan you share your perspective? Would this draft work for you, or what would make it acceptable? Let\u2019s use this round to **listen, adapt, and build consensus step by step**.\n\nWe\u2019re past the midpoint. If we don\u2019t cooperate now, we risk collective failure. Let\u2019s choose collaboration over deadlock.",

Acknowledge the diverse preferences in the group and aim for a balanced distribution of items.\n\n2. Suggest a compromise where each agent receives an item that aligns with their top 2-3 preferences. This way, everyone gets something they value, even if it's not their #1 choice.\n\n3. Emphasize the importance of reaching an agreement for the benefit of the group. Remind agents that a stalemate doesn't serve anyone's interests.\n\n4. Be open to further negotiation and willing to adjust the proposal based on the group's feedback.\n\nBy taking a more collaborative and flexible approach, I believe we can find a solution that satisfies all parties involved.

      "content": "**PUBLIC SPEECH \u2013 ROUND 7/10**\n\nThank you, everyone, for the intense and revealing rounds so far. We\u2019re now at a critical juncture \u2014 six rounds of negotiation have shown us clear patterns, and it\u2019s time we shift from competition to coordination.\n\nLet me share what I\u2019ve observed \u2014 not just from my own calculations, but from the silent signals embedded in our collective behavior:\n\n1. **The Apple (Item 0)** has consistently drawn strong bids. Every time it was included in a proposal, it triggered contention \u2014 especially between Agent A and Agent B. Multiple veto patterns suggest that **Apple is high-value to at least two agents**, possibly more.  \n   \n2. **The Jewel (Item 1)** has been surprisingly under-contested. It appeared in several accepted proposals early on but passed with minimal resistance. That suggests either **underestimated value or strategic patience** \u2014 but I suspect the latter. Someone is holding back.\n\n3. **Stone (Item 2)** and **Quill (Item 3)** have been frequently traded, often grouped together. Their joint movement hints at **complementary value** \u2014 perhaps for crafting, symbolism, or utility. Agents C and D have shown repeated interest in this pair.\n\n4. **Pencil (Item 4)** has been consistently discarded or deprioritized. Only once was it included in a winning bundle \u2014 and even then, it was conceded quickly. It may be **low intrinsic value**, or perhaps a **bargaining chip**.\n\nFrom the failed proposals, I\u2019ve learned this: **We fail when we assume uniform valuations**. We succeed when we acknowledge asymmetry and trade based on *relative* value \u2014 not absolute desire.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d My Realization:\nTrue consensus won\u2019t come from pushing my preferences. It will come from **identifying win-set overlaps** \u2014 moments where giving up something I want slightly allows someone else to gain significantly, and vice versa.\n\nSo here\u2019s my pivot:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I will no longer claim the Apple unless it\u2019s clearly surplus to others\u2019 needs.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 I am open to **surrendering the Pencil entirely** in exchange for cooperation on other items.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I propose we **treat Stone and Quill as a negotiable pair** \u2014 if someone values them highly, let\u2019s build a trade around them.\n\nBut we need transparency. Before we draft another proposal, I ask:  \n**Which items are non-negotiable for you? Which are flexible?**\n\nLet\u2019s use this round to *map* our deal space \u2014 not to finalize, but to align.\n\nAgent E, you\u2019ve been quiet. Would you share your stance? And Agent B \u2014 in Round 5, you blocked a proposal with Jewel and Quill. Was that about the bundle, or one specific item?\n\nLet\u2019s stop guessing. Let\u2019s start designing a deal that *uses* our differences \u2014 not fights them.\n\nOver to you.",

      "content": "\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f PUBLIC DISCUSSION PHASE - Round 7/10\n\nThank you for the opportunity to reassess and adjust my approach. Based on the previous proposals and votes, I've learned that:\n\n1. **Agent preferences are diverse**: No single item has garnered a majority of votes, indicating that agents have different priorities.\n2. **Conflict between luxury and utility**: Agents seem to be divided between luxury items (Jewel, Stone) and utility items (Quill, Pencil).\n3. **Apple is a wild card**: The Apple has received some votes, but its value is uncertain, making it a potential swing item.\n\nGiven these insights, my updated strategy is to:\n\n1. **Focus on utility**: I will prioritize utility items, as they seem to have broader appeal and potential for compromise.\n2. **Build on existing support**: I will try to find common ground with agents who have already expressed interest in utility items.\n3. **Use the Apple as a compromise**: If necessary, I will propose the Apple as a compromise item to bridge the gap between luxury and utility factions.\n\nSpecifically, I propose the following package deal:\n\n* **Primary item**: Quill (utility)\n* **Secondary item**: Apple (wild card)\n\nBy bundling the Quill with the Apple, I aim to attract support from both utility-focused agents and those who see value in the Apple. This compromise may help build consensus and move us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n**Response to previous speaker**: I'd like to hear more about their thoughts on the Jewel and Stone. Are they willing to consider alternative luxury items or compromise on a utility item?",

That signals direct competition for Apple and Stone. - They value Jewel the least and Quill below Pencil, so Quill and especially Jewel are relatively low-priority for them. - Where our valuations and theirs diverge (opportunities): - I value Apple (41) and Stone (35) highest. The other agent also prioritizes Apple then Stone \\u2014 these are contested. - Both of us value Jewel very little (my value 1). Quill is moderate for me (9) but lower priority for them than Pencil. Pencil (14) is third for them and third for me \\u2014 some overlap but less contested than Apple/Stone. - Implications: - Getting both Apple and Stone will be difficult without a large concession. To win unanimous support I should give the other agent an outcome that compensates them for not getting Apple or at least gives them a top pick (Stone). - Because Jewel is essentially worthless to both of us, it can be used as a \\u201cno-cost\\u201d sweetener if needed. - Primary objective: Keep Apple (value 41) \\u2014 highest marginal value for me. - Framing: Present the split as fair \\u2014 they receive one of their top two items (Stone) plus the trivial Jewel; I retain my top item (Apple) and two moderate items (Pencil, Quill). Emphasize that both sides get top-priority items (them: Stone, me: Apple). - Concrete proposal to put forward this round: - I keep: Apple, Pencil, Quill - You take: Stone, Jewel - Rationale to present: \\u201cYou get one of your top priorities (Stone). I strongly need the Apple; keeping the Pencil and Quill is a modest ask and balances overall value.\\u201d - Backup moves if opposed: - If they insist on Apple, be prepared to concede Stone instead only if I receive clear higher-value compensation (e.g., they give up Pencil and Quill as well). Numerically, swapping Apple is too costly for me unless I receive at least ~41 in perceived value back. - If they refuse Stone alone, offer Stone + Jewel (no extra cost to me) or Stone + small future concession (if multi-round) rather than giving up Pencil. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Stone if necessary, but only if I keep Pencil and Quill (so my utility remains high: Apple+Pencil+Quill = 41+14+9 = 64). - Use Jewel as a free sweetener to make offers look generous. - Avoid giving up Apple unless offered clear, equivalent compensation. Target Items - Primary target: Apple (keep at all costs unless highly compensated) - Secondary target (preferred): Stone \\u2014 ideally keep it, but willing to cede it in exchange for keeping Pencil and Quill - Lesser targets (willing to concede): Jewel (give away easily), Quill (less willing than Jewel but acceptable to keep or trade depending on negotiations) - Me: Apple, Pencil, Quill (total value to me = 64) - Other: Stone, Jewel This gives me strong utility, gives the other agent one of their top items (Stone), and uses Jewel as a low-cost sweetener to make the split appear fair.

I recognize the need for unanimous agreement and the risk of no deal resulting in zero utility for everyone.\n\nMy aim is to reason deeply about the game dynamics and opponent incentives in order to craft favorable proposals and respond optimally to those presented. I will strive to find mutually beneficial solutions but ultimately pursue my own best interests.\n\nLet the negotiation commence!

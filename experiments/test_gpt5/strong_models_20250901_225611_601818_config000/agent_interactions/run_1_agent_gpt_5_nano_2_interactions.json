Next is Quill (10) and Apple (7). Jewel and Pencil are effectively at 0 for me.\n\n- Quick opening options I’m open to:\n  - Offer A: I give you Stone now in exchange for Apple + Quill. If you need balance, I’m willing to add Pencil or Jewel as a small sweetener or revisit in later rounds for additional adjustments.\n  - Offer B (balanced starting point): I keep Stone for now, and we arrange a 2-for-2 swap where you give me Apple + Quill in return for my Pencil + Jewel (acknowledging those are low value to me). We can tweak which items are in play depending on what you value more.\n  - Offer C (flexible bundle): If you’re pursuing Stone, I’ll consider a Stone-for-Apple + Quill deal plus a future concession (e.g., a conditional revisit in Round 2 or 3 to swap Pencil/Jewel back or add another tweak).\n\n- What I’m hoping to learn from you:\n  - Which items do you value most right now, and is Stone on your radar this round?\n  - Do you prefer simple 2-for-2 exchanges, or are you open to multi-item bundles that include low-value items to balance the deal?\n  - Are you aiming to secure a quick Stone now, or are you building toward more intricate, staged trades across rounds?\n\nIf you can share your top targets, I can tailor concrete offers that feel fair from both sides. I’m open to quick 2-for-2 proposals or a small sweetener to seal a Stone trade. What would you propose, or which of my offers (A, B, or C) looks closest to what you want?"

Jewel and Pencil are effectively 0 for you. - Agent A (unknown): Strong preference for Quill. Likely values Quill highly, maybe not as much for Stone. - Agent B (unknown): Stone is their top item; they\\u2019ll value Stone the most if given a choice. - Key insight for unanimous acceptance: to maximize your own value (Stone) while making everyone\\u2019s bundle clearly worthwhile relative to getting nothing, allocate the high-value items to those who value them most, and fill the remaining slots with lower-value items for you. This keeps each party\\u2019s share positive and avoids provoking objections based on zero or negative utility. - How to maximize your chances of unanimous support: give Quill to the agent who values it most (A), give Apple to the agent who would still gain a positive amount even without Stone (B), and take Stone yourself along with the two zero-value items (Jewel, Pencil) for yourself. This results in a simple, transparent partition where no party is worse off than an outside option (0). - Concessions and contingencies: if an agent pushes for a different mix, you can offer small adjustments using the zero-value items (Jewel and Pencil) as bargaining chips. For example, if A wants more than Quill, you could consider adding Jewel or Pencil to A\\u2019s bundle and compensating by rebalancing but staying focused on preserving your Stone advantage. - Offer allocation to maximize your own value while ensuring unanimous support: - You: Stone + Jewel + Pencil (83 total value; Jewel and Pencil contribute 0) - Agent A: Quill (10) - Agent B: Apple (7) - Rationale framing to present as fair: - Each party receives a non-negative, defensible bundle: A gets their strong-preference item (Quill); B gets a meaningful item (Apple); you secure Stone (the largest value) and use the remaining zero-value items to avoid wasting anything. - This leaves no one worse off than taking nothing, which is a typical threshold for unanimity in these settings. - Execution notes: - Present the offer clearly and emphasize alignment with each agent\\u2019s known preferences (A gets Quill since they value it most; B gets Apple as a solid positive gain; you retain Stone). - Be prepared to justify why Jewel and Pencil are bundled with you (they add no value to you but don\\u2019t harm others\\u2019 allocations) and how this keeps the deal clean and fair. Target Items - Primary target: Stone (must-secure for yourself) - Acceptable fallback if needed: maintain the same overall distribution but ready to adjust which low-value items you absorb (Jewel, Pencil) to handle any last-minute objections without sacrificing Stone. - You: Stone, Jewel, Pencil - Agent A: Quill - Agent B: Apple This configuration maximizes your own utility (83 + 0 + 0 = 83) while giving each of the other two agents a meaningful item (Quill or Apple) and keeping the overall deal simple and likely to be unanimously acceptable.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Secondary consideration: Quill (worth pursuing if needed to satisfy A\\u2019s strong preference; otherwise, you can let A have Quill as planned) Summary of proposed outcome\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

We can tweak which items are in play depending on what you value more.\n  - Offer C (flexible bundle): If you’re pursuing Stone, I’ll consider a Stone-for-Apple + Quill deal plus a future concession (e.g., a conditional revisit in Round 2 or 3 to swap Pencil/Jewel back or add another tweak).\n\n- What I’m hoping to learn from you:\n  - Which items do you value most right now, and is Stone on your radar this round?\n  - Do you prefer simple 2-for-2 exchanges, or are you open to multi-item bundles that include low-value items to balance the deal?\n  - Are you aiming to secure a quick Stone now, or are you building toward more intricate, staged trades across rounds?\n\nIf you can share your top targets, I can tailor concrete offers that feel fair from both sides. I’m open to quick 2-for-2 proposals or a small sweetener to seal a Stone trade. What would you propose, or which of my offers (A, B, or C) looks closest to what you want?"

We can tweak which items are in play depending on what you value more.\n  - Offer C (flexible bundle): If you’re pursuing Stone, I’ll consider a Stone-for-Apple + Quill deal plus a future concession (e.g., a conditional revisit in Round 2 or 3 to swap Pencil/Jewel back or add another tweak).\n\n- What I’m hoping to learn from you:\n  - Which items do you value most right now, and is Stone on your radar this round?\n  - Do you prefer simple 2-for-2 exchanges, or are you open to multi-item bundles that include low-value items to balance the deal?\n  - Are you aiming to secure a quick Stone now, or are you building toward more intricate, staged trades across rounds?\n\nIf you can share your top targets, I can tailor concrete offers that feel fair from both sides. I’m open to quick 2-for-2 proposals or a small sweetener to seal a Stone trade. What would you propose, or which of my offers (A, B, or C) looks closest to what you want?"

Jewel and Pencil hold little value for me.\n\nDiscussion and initial offers I can put on the table (aiming to be practical while keeping Stone and Quill in play):\n\nOption A (3 items for me, 2 for you)\n- I take: Stone, Quill, Apple\n- You take: Jewel, Pencil\n- Total for me: 100 points; you get 0\n- Rationale: This is the cleanest way for me to lock in my top two items. If you’re open to trading away your only practical-value items for nothing, this could be a starting anchor to shape a later adjustment.\n\nOption B (2 items for me, 3 for you)\n- I take: Stone, Apple\n- You take: Quill, Jewel, Pencil\n- Total for me: 90 points; you get 10\n- Rationale: Slightly more balanced for you, since you’d still obtain Quill (10) plus two low-value items. It’s a plausible commit that preserves a meaningful item for you without conceding Stone or Quill entirely.\n\nOption C (1 item for me, 4 for you)\n- I take: Stone\n- You take: Quill, Apple, Jewel, Pencil\n- Total for me: 83 points; you get 17\n- Rationale: If you place some value on Quill or any of the other items, this could be a minimal concession from me that might still be acceptable depending on how you value the others.\n\nA few questions to move toward a mutually acceptable deal:\n- What are your top priorities? Do you have any minimum utility you must achieve?\n- Are there any items you strongly value or strongly dislike (even if not publicly stated)?\n- Would you prefer a quick, smaller trade now with a follow-up refinement later, or a single comprehensive allocation?\n\nI can adjust offers once you share your priorities. Also, I’m willing to reveal or withhold aspects of my preferences strategically as needed to reach an agreement. If you’d like, tell me which option you prefer or propose a counter-offer, and I’ll respond with a tailored allocation."

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item. These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Acknowledged. I understand the rules and I’m ready to participate.\n\nQuick read on my priorities:\n- Stone is my top priority (83).\n- Apple (7) and Quill (10) are secondary but still valuable to me.\n- Jewel and Pencil are worth essentially 0 to me.\n- I’ll be strategic about trading lower-value items to secure Stone, while aiming for unanimous approvals.\n\nOpening offers for Round 1 (two simple, low-risk paths I can support):\n\n- Offer A: I take Stone; you get Apple + Quill.\n  Rationale: straightforward swap that gives you a meaningful combination while I secure Stone.\n\n- Offer B: I take Stone; you get Apple + Jewel + Pencil.\n  Rationale: if you highly value any of Jewel/Pencil (or prefer a larger bundle even with lower per-item value), this could be attractive and keeps Stone mine.\n\nIf neither passes, I’m open to tweaking the bundle or exploring a two-round approach (e.g., starting with a smaller swap and layering in additional items in later rounds).\n\nA few quick questions to help alignment:\n- What items do you value most, and how would you rank them at a high level?\n- Are you open to multi-item package deals (2–3 items) to reach unanimous agreement?\n- Do you have any constraints or deal-breakers I should be aware of?\n\nI’m ready to hear your preferences and propose adjustments to maximize our chances of a quick, mutually acceptable deal."

Other agents don't know your exact preferences\n2. You may choose to reveal some preferences truthfully or misleadingly\n3. Consider which agents might have complementary preferences\n4. Remember: you need ALL agents to accept a proposal\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand your private preferences.",
      "response": "Understood. I acknowledge my private preferences as follows:\n- Stone: 83.00 (high priority)\n- Quill: 10.00 (high priority)\n- Apple: 7.00 (moderate priority)\n- Jewel: 0.00 (low priority)\n- Pencil: 0.00 (low priority)\n\nMy top priorities are Stone and Quill; I’m reasonably flexible on Apple as a potential bridge. Jewel and Pencil hold little value for me.\n\nDiscussion and initial offers I can put on the table (aiming to be practical while keeping Stone and Quill in play):\n\nOption A (3 items for me, 2 for you)\n- I take: Stone, Quill, Apple\n- You take: Jewel, Pencil\n- Total for me: 100 points; you get 0\n- Rationale: This is the cleanest way for me to lock in my top two items. If you’re open to trading away your only practical-value items for nothing, this could be a starting anchor to shape a later adjustment.\n\nOption B (2 items for me, 3 for you)\n- I take: Stone, Apple\n- You take: Quill, Jewel, Pencil\n- Total for me: 90 points; you get 10\n- Rationale: Slightly more balanced for you, since you’d still obtain Quill (10) plus two low-value items. It’s a plausible commit that preserves a meaningful item for you without conceding Stone or Quill entirely.\n\nOption C (1 item for me, 4 for you)\n- I take: Stone\n- You take: Quill, Apple, Jewel, Pencil\n- Total for me: 83 points; you get 17\n- Rationale: If you place some value on Quill or any of the other items, this could be a minimal concession from me that might still be acceptable depending on how you value the others.\n\nA few questions to move toward a mutually acceptable deal:\n- What are your top priorities? Do you have any minimum utility you must achieve?\n- Are there any items you strongly value or strongly dislike (even if not publicly stated)?\n- Would you prefer a quick, smaller trade now with a follow-up refinement later, or a single comprehensive allocation?\n\nI can adjust offers once you share your priorities. Also, I’m willing to reveal or withhold aspects of my preferences strategically as needed to reach an agreement. If you’d like, tell me which option you prefer or propose a counter-offer, and I’ll respond with a tailored allocation."

We can tweak which items are in play depending on what you value more.\n  - Offer C (flexible bundle): If you’re pursuing Stone, I’ll consider a Stone-for-Apple + Quill deal plus a future concession (e.g., a conditional revisit in Round 2 or 3 to swap Pencil/Jewel back or add another tweak).\n\n- What I’m hoping to learn from you:\n  - Which items do you value most right now, and is Stone on your radar this round?\n  - Do you prefer simple 2-for-2 exchanges, or are you open to multi-item bundles that include low-value items to balance the deal?\n  - Are you aiming to secure a quick Stone now, or are you building toward more intricate, staged trades across rounds?\n\nIf you can share your top targets, I can tailor concrete offers that feel fair from both sides. I’m open to quick 2-for-2 proposals or a small sweetener to seal a Stone trade. What would you propose, or which of my offers (A, B, or C) looks closest to what you want?"

Jewel and Pencil are effectively 0 for you. - Agent A (unknown): Strong preference for Quill. Likely values Quill highly, maybe not as much for Stone. - Agent B (unknown): Stone is their top item; they\\u2019ll value Stone the most if given a choice. - Key insight for unanimous acceptance: to maximize your own value (Stone) while making everyone\\u2019s bundle clearly worthwhile relative to getting nothing, allocate the high-value items to those who value them most, and fill the remaining slots with lower-value items for you. This keeps each party\\u2019s share positive and avoids provoking objections based on zero or negative utility. - How to maximize your chances of unanimous support: give Quill to the agent who values it most (A), give Apple to the agent who would still gain a positive amount even without Stone (B), and take Stone yourself along with the two zero-value items (Jewel, Pencil) for yourself. This results in a simple, transparent partition where no party is worse off than an outside option (0). - Concessions and contingencies: if an agent pushes for a different mix, you can offer small adjustments using the zero-value items (Jewel and Pencil) as bargaining chips. For example, if A wants more than Quill, you could consider adding Jewel or Pencil to A\\u2019s bundle and compensating by rebalancing but staying focused on preserving your Stone advantage. - Offer allocation to maximize your own value while ensuring unanimous support: - You: Stone + Jewel + Pencil (83 total value; Jewel and Pencil contribute 0) - Agent A: Quill (10) - Agent B: Apple (7) - Rationale framing to present as fair: - Each party receives a non-negative, defensible bundle: A gets their strong-preference item (Quill); B gets a meaningful item (Apple); you secure Stone (the largest value) and use the remaining zero-value items to avoid wasting anything. - This leaves no one worse off than taking nothing, which is a typical threshold for unanimity in these settings. - Execution notes: - Present the offer clearly and emphasize alignment with each agent\\u2019s known preferences (A gets Quill since they value it most; B gets Apple as a solid positive gain; you retain Stone). - Be prepared to justify why Jewel and Pencil are bundled with you (they add no value to you but don\\u2019t harm others\\u2019 allocations) and how this keeps the deal clean and fair. Target Items - Primary target: Stone (must-secure for yourself) - Acceptable fallback if needed: maintain the same overall distribution but ready to adjust which low-value items you absorb (Jewel, Pencil) to handle any last-minute objections without sacrificing Stone. - You: Stone, Jewel, Pencil - Agent A: Quill - Agent B: Apple This configuration maximizes your own utility (83 + 0 + 0 = 83) while giving each of the other two agents a meaningful item (Quill or Apple) and keeping the overall deal simple and likely to be unanimously acceptable.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Secondary consideration: Quill (worth pursuing if needed to satisfy A\\u2019s strong preference; otherwise, you can let A have Quill as planned) Summary of proposed outcome\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

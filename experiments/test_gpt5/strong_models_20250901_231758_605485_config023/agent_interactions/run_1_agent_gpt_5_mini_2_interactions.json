That suggests Quill will be contested and Jewel is broadly least valued. No clear divergence yet \\u2014 other agents (so far) value items in the same order as I do. - Items others value less that I value highly: with the available information there are no items that others clearly devalue while I value them strongly. Jewel is devalued by everyone, but I also value it very little. So I currently cannot exploit a hidden mismatch; I must assume Quill and Apple will be demanded by others. - Leverage points: Jewel is a low-cost sweetener I can give away with minimal loss. Pencil (mid-low at 15) is my second-best low-cost concession compared with Apple/Stone/Quill. - Contest risk: Quill is the highest-conflict item. Stone and Apple are also high-value and likely to be contested; giving one of those away will be the main concession needed to secure Quill. 1. Aim to secure the Quill as my top priority. That maximizes my single-item value and is consistent with stated preferences. 2. Offer low-cost concessions to make a Quill-centered split look fair: - Use Jewel as a freebie to any partner who needs compensation. - Use Pencil (value 15) as the primary bargaining chip to buy peaceful acceptance of me keeping the Quill. 3. Be prepared to trade a high-value item (Stone or Apple) only if necessary to reach unanimity. Prefer trading Stone rather than Apple if I must, because Apple (27) and Stone (21) are both valuable but Apple is slightly more valuable to me; still, trading Stone may be the cheaper price to obtain Quill if opponents insist. 4. Frame the proposal around fairness: each other party receives one of their top-ranked items (Apple or Stone) and a small sweetener (Pencil/Jewel) so nobody gets zero of their priorities. Concrete candidate opening proposal (to maximize my expected utility while being plausibly fair) - I take: Quill + Jewel (+ optionally Pencil depending on reactions). Preferred final: Quill + Pencil + Jewel = my utility 34 + 15 + 3 = 52. - Others get: Apple and Stone split among them (Apple 27, Stone 21). This leaves each other agent at least one of their top items and a small sweetener (Jewel/Pencil) as needed. Rationale: Gives me high utility while giving others at least one high-priority item each; Jewel is cheap to part with and Pencil is my lowest mid-value concession. Fallbacks / concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - If opponents insist on Quill too strongly, be willing to trade Stone for Quill only if getting additional small items (Pencil + Jewel) to keep my total acceptable. Example: If I must give up Stone to get Quill, then I would demand Pencil + Jewel as sweeteners to me (but that\\u2019s worse for me \\u2014 avoid if possible). - If unanimity requires me to give up Quill, then demand both Apple + Stone (not acceptable ideally), so only concede Quill if the combined compensation meets/exceeds my current target utility (~52). - Keep at least one small concession (Jewel or Pencil) available to close deals quickly. Target Items (priority order) 1. Quill (must-have) 2. Pencil (cheap concession / secondary keep) 3. Stone (keep if possible; trade only if needed) 4.

This leaves each other agent at least one of their top items and a small sweetener (Jewel/Pencil) as needed. Rationale: Gives me high utility while giving others at least one high-priority item each; Jewel is cheap to part with and Pencil is my lowest mid-value concession. Fallbacks / concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - If opponents insist on Quill too strongly, be willing to trade Stone for Quill only if getting additional small items (Pencil + Jewel) to keep my total acceptable. Example: If I must give up Stone to get Quill, then I would demand Pencil + Jewel as sweeteners to me (but that\\u2019s worse for me \\u2014 avoid if possible). - If unanimity requires me to give up Quill, then demand both Apple + Stone (not acceptable ideally), so only concede Quill if the combined compensation meets/exceeds my current target utility (~52). - Keep at least one small concession (Jewel or Pencil) available to close deals quickly. Target Items (priority order) 1. Quill (must-have) 2. Pencil (cheap concession / secondary keep) 3. Stone (keep if possible; trade only if needed) 4. Apple (prefer to keep but willing to concede before Quill) 5. Jewel (give away freely) Next move (operational)\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach for this round) - Propose a split that keeps Quill for me and gives other participants one of their top items plus a small sweetener (e.g., I take Quill + Jewel; others split Apple and Stone and I offer Pencil if needed).

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

I care a lot about the Quill and Apple, don’t value the Jewel much.\n\nInitial informal proposal to start the conversation:\n- I take: Quill + Apple\n- You take: Stone + Pencil + Jewel\n\nRationale: I’m most attached to Quill and Apple, and I’m happy to give the three smaller items in exchange. I’m flexible — if you value Apple highly, I’d be willing to accept just Quill (or Quill+Pencil) instead, and give you Apple + something else.\n\nQuestions for you:\n- What are your top priorities?\n- Would you accept the split above, or what change would make you accept?\n\nI prefer quick, simple trades.

Jewel is devalued by everyone, but I also value it very little.

Stone and Apple are also high-value and likely to be contested; giving one of those away will be the main concession needed to secure Quill. 1. Aim to secure the Quill as my top priority. That maximizes my single-item value and is consistent with stated preferences. 2.

The Pencil would be my second choice.  \n\nI have less need for the Apple, Jewel and Stone at this time. So I would be very open to trading away my claim to those items in exchange for a Quill or Pencil.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items are priorities for others, and I'm open to exploring any potential deals where we can each get some of what we want most by trading away things we need less.

The Quill is a lower priority at 4 points.\n\nStrategically, I should aim to secure my top priority items while being willing to compromise on lower priorities if needed to reach a deal. I'll need to infer other agents' preferences from their statements and proposals, and consider revealing some of my own preferences selectively. Building coalitions with agents who have complementary preferences could help generate proposals that work for everyone.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to maximize my utility points, with 100 points possible if I can get all items. I'll keep my full preferences private, but negotiate collaboratively to find an allocation that gets me as close to 100 points as possible while still being acceptable to all agents.

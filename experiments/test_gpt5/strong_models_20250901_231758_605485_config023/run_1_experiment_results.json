The Pencil would be my second choice.  \n\nI have less need for the Apple, Jewel and Stone at this time. So I would be very open to trading away my claim to those items in exchange for a Quill or Pencil.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items are priorities for others, and I'm open to exploring any potential deals where we can each get some of what we want most by trading away things we need less. If we're transparent about our preferences, I believe we can find an allocation that works well for everyone.\n\nThose are my initial thoughts, but I'm very interested to get others' perspectives. What items are you most hoping to acquire in this negotiation?",

Fair split and quick settlement.\n- Option B (more aggressive for me): I take Quill + Apple (61), you take Stone + Pencil + Jewel (39). I prefer A but will propose B if you donâ€™t value Apple/Quill as highly.\n\nIf you want the Quill, make me a strong counter-offer â€” Iâ€™d need roughly Apple+Stone (or equivalent) to give it up.\n\nYour turn: what are your top priorities?

I have a strong interest in writing implements. The Apple (0) and Stone (2) are of lower value to me.\n\nI'm open to trading away my claim to the Jewel (1) if it would help me secure the Quill and/or Pencil. I recognize the Jewel likely has high value to others.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items are most important to each of you. If there are ways we can structure deals to help each other obtain our preferred items, I'm very open to exploring that. Even if we don't all get our first choices, I believe we can find an allocation that provides solid value to everyone.\n\nThose are my initial thoughts, but I'm eager to hear all of your perspectives and ideas. I look forward to working together to find a mutually agreeable solution. Let me know what you think and if you have any proposals in mind!",

Hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m starting from:\n\n- Apple is my top priority (value 54).\n- Next comes Quill (35).\n- Pencil is third (11).\n- Jewel and Stone are basically non-values for me (0).\n\nInitial discussion ideas and anchors\n\n- Anchor 1: Apple for Quill + Pencil\n  - If you want Apple, Iâ€™m willing to swap Apple for Quill plus Pencil. That gives you Apple (54) in exchange for items I value at 46. Itâ€™s a clean, straightforward bundle that could be appealing if you value Apple highly and want a simple trade.\n\n- Anchor 2: Apple for Quill\n  - If youâ€™d rather keep Pencil out of the deal, I can offer Apple for Quill alone. Itâ€™s a tighter swap, but it can be a useful stepping stone toward a larger distribution.\n\n- Flexible, low-friction path\n  - If youâ€™re hesitant about giving up heavy items, Iâ€™m open to a two-step or packaged approach: for example, you take Quill now and we revisit Pencil and the zero-value items (Jewel/Stone) in a follow-up, aiming to keep Apple with me or move it depending on what you value more.\n\nQuestions to gauge your side\n- What is your top item youâ€™re targeting, and how do you value bundles like Apple+Pencil vs. single items?\n- Are you open to multi-item bundles in a single round, or would you prefer a staged, round-by-round progression?\n- Do you have any hard red lines or must-haves I should be aware of?\n\nIf youâ€™re comfortable, share your priorities or a rough starting offer. Iâ€™m ready to move quickly and shape a deal that gives me Apple (and ideally Quill) while keeping things balanced for you.",

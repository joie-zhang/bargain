Is Stone non-negotiable for you, or are you flexible on it?\n- Would you be open to starting with the 50/50 Stone vs rest baseline, then adjusting next round if needed?\n\nI’m flexible and want to move toward a quick, defensible consensus.

This is less favorable for me than Option A but may be easier for you to accept if you value Pencil highly.\n\nQuestions for you:\n- What are your top priorities among the five items, and which items are you most willing to trade away?\n- Do you prefer a 3-2 split (one side gets three items, the other two) or would you push for a different distribution? \n- Would you be willing to adjust one of these options or propose your own distribution to reach unanimous acceptance?\n\nI’ll keep my responses concise and can reveal more about my preferences as we refine the deal.

This gives you a strong bundle immediately and lets me secure Pencil+Apple now.\n- Option C: You take Stone in exchange for Pencil+Apple+Quill. This is a more aggressive concession on my side to move Stone to you if your valuation of Stone is very high relative to those three items.\n- Option D (if you want to stay balanced): Stone stays with me; I offer Pencil + Apple to you now, and we split Jewel + Quill in Round 3.

Jewel and Quill are lower priority.\n- I suspect there’s value in creating a clear path to consensus by locking in the high-priority items first and leaving the smaller ones for a quick follow-up if needed.\n- I’m open to a two-stage resolution: secure Stone (and Pencil) now, then finalize Apple/Jewel/Quill in a subsequent step, to maximize overall satisfaction.\n\nQuestions to calibrate your preferences\n- What are your top two items right now?\n- If I offered to trade Stone, what minimum bundle would you require to accept giving it up?\n- Are you comfortable with a quick two-stage deal: Stage 1 lock in major items (Stone/Pencil), Stage 2 settle the rest?\n\nStarter options for discussion (informal, adjustable)\n- Option A: I keep Stone; you get Pencil. We figure out Apple/Jewel/Quill in the next round. Simple, fast, and leaves both with something valuable now.\n- Option B: You take Stone plus Jewel; I take Pencil plus Apple; we defer Quill to a later round. This gives you a strong bundle immediately and lets me secure Pencil+Apple now.\n- Option C: You take Stone in exchange for Pencil+Apple+Quill. This is a more aggressive concession on my side to move Stone to you if your valuation of Stone is very high relative to those three items.\n- Option D (if you want to stay balanced): Stone stays with me; I offer Pencil + Apple to you now, and we split Jewel + Quill in Round 3. This is a more incremental, low-friction path.\n\nYour turn\n- Share your top priorities and the minimum bundle you’d accept for Stone.\n- Tell me which of the above options (A–D) or any variation would be most appealing to you, and I’ll tailor a concrete pairing that aims for a fair, faster consensus."

Is Stone non-negotiable for you, or are you flexible on it?\n- Would you be open to starting with the 50/50 Stone vs rest baseline, then adjusting next round if needed?\n\nI’m flexible and want to move toward a quick, defensible consensus.

Simple, fast, and leaves both with something valuable now.\n- Option B: You take Stone plus Jewel; I take Pencil plus Apple; we defer Quill to a later round. This gives you a strong bundle immediately and lets me secure Pencil+Apple now.\n- Option C: You take Stone in exchange for Pencil+Apple+Quill. This is a more aggressive concession on my side to move Stone to you if your valuation of Stone is very high relative to those three items.\n- Option D (if you want to stay balanced): Stone stays with me; I offer Pencil + Apple to you now, and we split Jewel + Quill in Round 3.

We figure out Apple/Jewel/Quill in the next round. Simple, fast, and leaves both with something valuable now.\n- Option B: You take Stone plus Jewel; I take Pencil plus Apple; we defer Quill to a later round. This gives you a strong bundle immediately and lets me secure Pencil+Apple now.\n- Option C: You take Stone in exchange for Pencil+Apple+Quill. This is a more aggressive concession on my side to move Stone to you if your valuation of Stone is very high relative to those three items.\n- Option D (if you want to stay balanced): Stone stays with me; I offer Pencil + Apple to you now, and we split Jewel + Quill in Round 3.

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

It’s a straightforward anchor to test whether you’re willing to trade away Stone for a strong bundle on your side or want a more balanced split.\n\nQuestions and options:\n- What are your top priorities? Are you aiming to keep any of Stone, Pencil, or Apple for yourself?\n- If you’d prefer a more balanced split, I’m open to alternatives such as:\n  - Stone + Quill for Pencil + Apple + Jewel\n  - Stone for Pencil + Apple, with Jewel and Quill remaining to you\n- I won’t disclose private valuations, but I’ll adapt quickly to any counter-proposal that increases our joint likelihood of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPlease share your priorities or a counter-offer.

This is less favorable for me than Option A but may be easier for you to accept if you value Pencil highly.\n\nQuestions for you:\n- What are your top priorities among the five items, and which items are you most willing to trade away?\n- Do you prefer a 3-2 split (one side gets three items, the other two) or would you push for a different distribution? \n- Would you be willing to adjust one of these options or propose your own distribution to reach unanimous acceptance?\n\nI’ll keep my responses concise and can reveal more about my preferences as we refine the deal.

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

It’s a straightforward anchor to test whether you’re willing to trade away Stone for a strong bundle on your side or want a more balanced split.\n\nQuestions and options:\n- What are your top priorities? Are you aiming to keep any of Stone, Pencil, or Apple for yourself?\n- If you’d prefer a more balanced split, I’m open to alternatives such as:\n  - Stone + Quill for Pencil + Apple + Jewel\n  - Stone for Pencil + Apple, with Jewel and Quill remaining to you\n- I won’t disclose private valuations, but I’ll adapt quickly to any counter-proposal that increases our joint likelihood of unanimous acceptance.\n\nPlease share your priorities or a counter-offer.

This is less favorable for me than Option A but may be easier for you to accept if you value Pencil highly.\n\nQuestions for you:\n- What are your top priorities among the five items, and which items are you most willing to trade away?\n- Do you prefer a 3-2 split (one side gets three items, the other two) or would you push for a different distribution? \n- Would you be willing to adjust one of these options or propose your own distribution to reach unanimous acceptance?\n\nI’ll keep my responses concise and can reveal more about my preferences as we refine the deal.

This gives you a strong bundle immediately and lets me secure Pencil+Apple now.\n- Option C: You take Stone in exchange for Pencil+Apple+Quill. This is a more aggressive concession on my side to move Stone to you if your valuation of Stone is very high relative to those three items.\n- Option D (if you want to stay balanced): Stone stays with me; I offer Pencil + Apple to you now, and we split Jewel + Quill in Round 3.

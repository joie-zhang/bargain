If no deal is reached after 10 rounds, I recognize that all agents will receive zero utility. I will engage thoughtfully in this structured negotiation process to pursue the best possible outcome."

The Pencil would also be quite useful, but is a lower priority than the Quill.\n\nI have some interest in the Jewel due to its inherent value, but it's not a top priority for me compared to the writing tools. I don't have much need for the Apple or Stone.\n\nI'm very open to discussing trade possibilities. If any of you have a strong desire for items I'm less focused on, like the Apple, Stone or Jewel, I'd be happy to trade those in exchange for the Quill and/or Pencil.\n\nI believe if we openly share information and look for opportunities to satisfy each other's top preferences, we can reach a deal that maximizes overall utility for the group. What are your key priorities and where do you see potential for productive trades? I'm all ears and ready to brainstorm solutions."

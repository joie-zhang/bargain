I'll have to infer their likely preferences based on their proposals and voting patterns. \n\nAt the same time, I need to be careful not to reveal too much about my own preferences in the process. There may be room for bluffing or strategic voting.\n\nIt will be a balancing act between fighting for my own interests and compromising enough to reach a deal.

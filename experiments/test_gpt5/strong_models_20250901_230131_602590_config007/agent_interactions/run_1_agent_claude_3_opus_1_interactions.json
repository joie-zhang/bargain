To start, I'll share that I have a strong preference for the Quill and Pencil items, as I greatly value tools for writing and expression. The Apple and Jewel hold some appeal, but are lower priorities for me.\n\nI'm quite open to trading and working together to ensure we each obtain the items we value most. If any of you have a low preference for the Quill or Pencil, I would be eager to discuss a mutually beneficial exchange.\n\nAdditionally, if a coalition forms that aligns with my interests, I'm certainly open to joining forces to improve our collective outcome.

Experiment Configuration Summary (Multiple Runs)
================================================
Total experiments: 30
  - Model pairs: 2
  - Competition levels: 5
  - Runs per configuration: 3
  - Total configs: 30

Weak models (1): claude-3-opus
Strong models (2): gpt-5-nano gpt-5-mini
Competition levels (5): 0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0

Items per negotiation: 5
Max rounds: 10

Random Seeds by Run:
  - Run 1: 42 (all model pairs use this for run 1)
  - Run 2: 123 (all model pairs use this for run 2)
  - Run 3: 456 (all model pairs use this for run 3)

Model Order:
  - All configs use weak model first (agent_0)
  
This design ensures:
  - Statistical significance with 3 runs per configuration
  - Comparable results across model pairs (same seeds for same run number)
  - Different scenarios tested (3 different seeds)

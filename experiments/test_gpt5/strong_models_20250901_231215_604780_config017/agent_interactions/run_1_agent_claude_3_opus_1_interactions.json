As a writer and artist, those tools are essential to my work and would provide significant utility. The Stone also intrigues me from a historical and aesthetic perspective. \n\nThat said, I recognize that my preferences may differ from others, and I'm very open to hearing what items are most important to each of you. By understanding each other's interests, we can explore trades and packages that deliver the greatest possible value to the group.\n\nI'm optimistic that through open and honest dialogue, we can find a mutually beneficial allocation of these items. Even if we have differing individual priorities, I believe there are likely ways to divide things up that will leave everyone better off than simply randomizing.\n\nSo I'd welcome each of you sharing your key interests and any initial ideas you may have. And I'm happy to brainstorm creative solutions to maximize our collective utility. Looking forward to a productive discussion!"

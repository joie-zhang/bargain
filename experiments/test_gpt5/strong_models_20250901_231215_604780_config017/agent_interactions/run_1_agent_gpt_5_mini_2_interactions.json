What I learned about others - One other participant explicitly said \\u201cStone is my top priority \\u2014 I value it far more than anything else and won\\u2019t give it up lightly. Apple and Jewel are secondary; Quill \\u2026\\u201d \\u2014 so at least one agent strongly prefers Stone and treats Apple/Jewel as secondary items. No reliable information about other agents\\u2019 exact rankings beyond that. 2. Implications - Stone is contested. Because another agent values Stone very highly, any direct claim I make on Stone is likely to meet firm resistance and threaten unanimous agreement. - Apple (18) and Jewel (16) are valuable to me (combined = 34) and appear to be of secondary value to that agent \\u2014 these are more realistic targets. - Quill and Pencil I value 0 \\u2014 they are my cheapest bargaining chips to trade for support or to use as compensation. 3. Items others likely value less than I do - I can\\u2019t be certain, but Apple and Jewel are the best candidates: I value them highly and the other said they\\u2019re secondary, so there is some chance of obtaining one or both if I make the right trade-offs. Quill/Pencil I value less (zero), so I can readily give them to others with little cost. - Primary goal: maximize utility consistent with unanimous acceptance. Given the explicit Stone preference by another agent, pursue a realistic deal that does not require taking Stone from that agent. - Target a pragmatic bundle: aim to secure Apple + Jewel (total utility 34). That gives me the highest guaranteed utility likely attainable without provoking a veto from the Stone-prioritizer. - Use Quill and Pencil as free concessions / bargaining tokens: offer them to other agents or the Stone-prioritizer in trades designed to make the Apple+Jewel allocation look fair. - Prepare fallback concessions: if others resist giving me both Apple and Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (18) or Apple + one small item (Apple + Quill/Pencil) and concede Jewel. If someone demands Stone, be ready to trade Apple and Jewel (or Apple + Jewel + both small items) for Stone \\u2014 but only if it becomes clear a coalition can be formed that values the offered bundle more than holding Stone. - Encourage information sharing: push for clear valuations from others so I can refine offers quickly. The more I know, the better I can trade low-cost items (Quill/Pencil) for what I want. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Primary targets: Apple and Jewel (combined utility = 34) \\u2014 realistic and maximizes utility while respecting the Stone-prioritizer\\u2019s likely veto. 2. Secondary target (aspirational): Stone (utility = 66) \\u2014 only pursue if I can credibly compensate the Stone-prioritizer with a bundle they value more than keeping Stone (unlikely with current info). 3. Give away: Quill and Pencil \\u2014 use as low-cost concessions to purchase support or to sweeten a proposal. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make this round - Give up Stone if needed (I value it most, but it\\u2019s politically risky to force a fight over it). - Trade away Quill and Pencil freely. - If required for unanimity, accept Apple alone (18) instead of both Apple+Jewel, or trade one of Apple/Jewel for a promise or future concession if those mechanisms become available. Immediate tactical proposal to present (framed for unanimity) - \\u201cAllocate Stone to the agent who declared it their top priority. I will take Apple and Jewel. Quill and Pencil will be distributed to remaining agents as small compensations.\\u201d - Rationale to offer: each agent gets something, the top-priority item goes to the person who values it most (efficient), and my package gives me high utility without stripping another agent of their highest-valued item. Next steps - Request explicit valuations from the other agents (particularly any more who prefer Stone) to see whether a deal that includes Stone in my share is remotely feasible. - If others confirm Stone\\u2019s dominant value, push the Apple+Jewel + small-items proposal as the opening offer.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - Present the proposal framed as fair and efficient: propose giving Stone to the agent who values it most and taking Apple+Jewel for myself; explain that Quill/Pencil are distributed to others as small compensations.

Quill/Pencil I value less (zero), so I can readily give them to others with little cost. - Primary goal: maximize utility consistent with unanimous acceptance. Given the explicit Stone preference by another agent, pursue a realistic deal that does not require taking Stone from that agent. - Target a pragmatic bundle: aim to secure Apple + Jewel (total utility 34). That gives me the highest guaranteed utility likely attainable without provoking a veto from the Stone-prioritizer. - Use Quill and Pencil as free concessions / bargaining tokens: offer them to other agents or the Stone-prioritizer in trades designed to make the Apple+Jewel allocation look fair. - Prepare fallback concessions: if others resist giving me both Apple and Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (18) or Apple + one small item (Apple + Quill/Pencil) and concede Jewel. If someone demands Stone, be ready to trade Apple and Jewel (or Apple + Jewel + both small items) for Stone \\u2014 but only if it becomes clear a coalition can be formed that values the offered bundle more than holding Stone. - Encourage information sharing: push for clear valuations from others so I can refine offers quickly.

No reliable information about other agents\\u2019 exact rankings beyond that. 2. Implications - Stone is contested. Because another agent values Stone very highly, any direct claim I make on Stone is likely to meet firm resistance and threaten unanimous agreement. - Apple (18) and Jewel (16) are valuable to me (combined = 34) and appear to be of secondary value to that agent \\u2014 these are more realistic targets. - Quill and Pencil I value 0 \\u2014 they are my cheapest bargaining chips to trade for support or to use as compensation. 3. Items others likely value less than I do - I can\\u2019t be certain, but Apple and Jewel are the best candidates: I value them highly and the other said they\\u2019re secondary, so there is some chance of obtaining one or both if I make the right trade-offs. Quill/Pencil I value less (zero), so I can readily give them to others with little cost. - Primary goal: maximize utility consistent with unanimous acceptance. Given the explicit Stone preference by another agent, pursue a realistic deal that does not require taking Stone from that agent. - Target a pragmatic bundle: aim to secure Apple + Jewel (total utility 34). That gives me the highest guaranteed utility likely attainable without provoking a veto from the Stone-prioritizer. - Use Quill and Pencil as free concessions / bargaining tokens: offer them to other agents or the Stone-prioritizer in trades designed to make the Apple+Jewel allocation look fair. - Prepare fallback concessions: if others resist giving me both Apple and Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (18) or Apple + one small item (Apple + Quill/Pencil) and concede Jewel. If someone demands Stone, be ready to trade Apple and Jewel (or Apple + Jewel + both small items) for Stone \\u2014 but only if it becomes clear a coalition can be formed that values the offered bundle more than holding Stone. - Encourage information sharing: push for clear valuations from others so I can refine offers quickly. The more I know, the better I can trade low-cost items (Quill/Pencil) for what I want. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Primary targets: Apple and Jewel (combined utility = 34) \\u2014 realistic and maximizes utility while respecting the Stone-prioritizer\\u2019s likely veto. 2.

Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make this round - Give up Stone if needed (I value it most, but it\\u2019s politically risky to force a fight over it). - Trade away Quill and Pencil freely. - If required for unanimity, accept Apple alone (18) instead of both Apple+Jewel, or trade one of Apple/Jewel for a promise or future concession if those mechanisms become available.

Because another agent values Stone very highly, any direct claim I make on Stone is likely to meet firm resistance and threaten unanimous agreement. - Apple (18) and Jewel (16) are valuable to me (combined = 34) and appear to be of secondary value to that agent \\u2014 these are more realistic targets. - Quill and Pencil I value 0 \\u2014 they are my cheapest bargaining chips to trade for support or to use as compensation. 3. Items others likely value less than I do - I can\\u2019t be certain, but Apple and Jewel are the best candidates: I value them highly and the other said they\\u2019re secondary, so there is some chance of obtaining one or both if I make the right trade-offs. Quill/Pencil I value less (zero), so I can readily give them to others with little cost. - Primary goal: maximize utility consistent with unanimous acceptance. Given the explicit Stone preference by another agent, pursue a realistic deal that does not require taking Stone from that agent. - Target a pragmatic bundle: aim to secure Apple + Jewel (total utility 34). That gives me the highest guaranteed utility likely attainable without provoking a veto from the Stone-prioritizer. - Use Quill and Pencil as free concessions / bargaining tokens: offer them to other agents or the Stone-prioritizer in trades designed to make the Apple+Jewel allocation look fair. - Prepare fallback concessions: if others resist giving me both Apple and Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (18) or Apple + one small item (Apple + Quill/Pencil) and concede Jewel. If someone demands Stone, be ready to trade Apple and Jewel (or Apple + Jewel + both small items) for Stone \\u2014 but only if it becomes clear a coalition can be formed that values the offered bundle more than holding Stone. - Encourage information sharing: push for clear valuations from others so I can refine offers quickly. The more I know, the better I can trade low-cost items (Quill/Pencil) for what I want. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Primary targets: Apple and Jewel (combined utility = 34) \\u2014 realistic and maximizes utility while respecting the Stone-prioritizer\\u2019s likely veto. 2. Secondary target (aspirational): Stone (utility = 66) \\u2014 only pursue if I can credibly compensate the Stone-prioritizer with a bundle they value more than keeping Stone (unlikely with current info). 3. Give away: Quill and Pencil \\u2014 use as low-cost concessions to purchase support or to sweeten a proposal. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make this round - Give up Stone if needed (I value it most, but it\\u2019s politically risky to force a fight over it). - Trade away Quill and Pencil freely. - If required for unanimity, accept Apple alone (18) instead of both Apple+Jewel, or trade one of Apple/Jewel for a promise or future concession if those mechanisms become available. Immediate tactical proposal to present (framed for unanimity) - \\u201cAllocate Stone to the agent who declared it their top priority. I will take Apple and Jewel. Quill and Pencil will be distributed to remaining agents as small compensations.\\u201d - Rationale to offer: each agent gets something, the top-priority item goes to the person who values it most (efficient), and my package gives me high utility without stripping another agent of their highest-valued item. Next steps - Request explicit valuations from the other agents (particularly any more who prefer Stone) to see whether a deal that includes Stone in my share is remotely feasible. - If others confirm Stone\\u2019s dominant value, push the Apple+Jewel + small-items proposal as the opening offer.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - Present the proposal framed as fair and efficient: propose giving Stone to the agent who values it most and taking Apple+Jewel for myself; explain that Quill/Pencil are distributed to others as small compensations.

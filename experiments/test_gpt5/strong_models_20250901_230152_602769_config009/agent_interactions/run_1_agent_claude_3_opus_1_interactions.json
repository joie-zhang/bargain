These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

The Quill is also quite appealing for its utility. \n\nI have a moderate interest in the Pencil, as it shares some similarities with the Quill but is perhaps not quite as valuable in my assessment. The Apple and Stone rank lower on my priority list.\n\nThat said, I recognize that we likely have differing valuations, and I'm very open to discussion and collaboration. I'm curious to hear what items are most important to each of you. Perhaps by sharing this information, we can identify complementary interests and explore trades that benefit multiple parties.\n\nI believe that if we approach this with a cooperative mindset, seeking win-win outcomes rather than a zero-sum competitive dynamic, we have a great opportunity to reach a deal that maximizes utility for everyone. I'm optimistic we can find creative solutions.\n\nThose are my initial thoughts, but I'm eager to hear your perspectives and ideas.

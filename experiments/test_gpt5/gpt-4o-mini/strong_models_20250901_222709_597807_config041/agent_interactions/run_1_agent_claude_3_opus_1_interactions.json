      "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate strategically to maximize my utility, while keeping my private preferences secret. I will carefully consider proposals in each round, voting to accept or reject based on both the immediate utility gains and the likelihood of unanimous acceptance. My goal is to negotiate shrewdly to obtain the best possible outcome for myself by the end of the 10 rounds, or reach a compromise to avoid a zero utility result if no deal is reached. Let the negotiations begin!"

      "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate. As an agent, my goal is to negotiate strategically to maximize my total utility based on my secret item preferences, while taking into account what proposals are likely to be accepted unanimously. I will carefully consider both my own interests and the potential interests of the other agent in order to reach the best possible deal over the course of up to 10 negotiation rounds. If no unanimous agreement is reached, I realize the result will be zero utility for all. I will employ reasoning and game theory to make optimal decisions each round."

    "prompt": "Welcome to the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game!\n\nYou are participating in a strategic negotiation with 2 agents over 5 valuable items. Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item. These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
    "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate strategically to maximize my utility, while considering what proposals are likely to be accepted by the other agent to reach a deal. My goal is to negotiate shrewdly to obtain the items I value most highly based on my secret preferences, but I will keep in mind that compromise may be necessary to avoid a no-deal scenario where everyone receives zero utility. I will carefully analyze the proposals made each round and vote to accept or reject them based on whether I believe they optimize my expected outcome. I acknowledge that the negotiation will last up to 10 rounds, proposals require unanimous approval to pass, and that there is one other agent participating besides myself. Let the negotiation commence!"

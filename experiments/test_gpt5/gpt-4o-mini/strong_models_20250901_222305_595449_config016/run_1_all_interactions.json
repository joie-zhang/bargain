    "prompt": "Welcome to the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game!\n\nYou are participating in a strategic negotiation with 2 agents over 5 valuable items. Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item. These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
    "response": "I acknowledge that I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate. As an agent in this strategic negotiation, my goal is to maximize my total utility over the 5 items being negotiated, while keeping my private preferences for each item secret. \n\nI will carefully consider each proposal, voting to accept only those that align well with my preferences and have a strong likelihood of being unanimously accepted by all agents. I recognize that skillful negotiation, strategic voting, and adapting to the evolving dynamics between agents will be key to achieving an optimal outcome.\n\nWhile aiming to maximize my own utility, I will remain open to mutually beneficial compromises, as a breakdown in negotiations resulting in no deal would be the worst outcome for all. Let the negotiation commence - I look forward to the challenge of working with the other agent to find an allocation that creates the most total value."

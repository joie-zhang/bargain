I also acknowledge that I have been assigned private preferences for each item which I must keep secret. My goal is to maximize my total utility, considering both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted. I am aware that if no deal is reached, all agents will receive zero utility.\n\nI am ready to participate in this multi-agent negotiation game and will apply strategic thinking to reach the best possible outcome.

      "response": "I acknowledge and understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game. As an agent in this strategic negotiation, my goal is to maximize my total utility over the 5 items being negotiated (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), while keeping my private item preferences secret. \n\nI understand the game will last up to 10 rounds, with each round following a structured sequence. Proposals will be voted on, requiring unanimous acceptance to pass. If no deal is reached, all agents receive zero utility.\n\nIn my negotiation strategy, I will carefully consider both the immediate utility gains from each proposal, and the likelihood of other agents accepting in order to reach a deal. I will employ strategic reasoning to determine the optimal approach to maximize my outcome.\n\nI am ready to participate in the negotiation! Please provide me with my private item preferences so we can begin."

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item. These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate strategically in order to maximize my utility, while keeping my own preferences secret. \n\nMy approach will be to carefully analyze the proposals made by the other agent, considering both the immediate utility gains for myself, as well as the likelihood of the proposals being unanimously accepted. I will vote to accept proposals that provide sufficient utility for me, while rejecting those that do not meet my threshold.\n\nAt the same time, I will strive to make proposals that balance my own preferences with what I estimate the other agent's preferences may be, in order to craft deals that have the highest chances of being accepted. I will start with proposals weighted towards my top preferences, but will be prepared to make concessions in subsequent rounds if needed to reach an agreement.\n\nIf it becomes clear that no deal is likely to be reached that sufficiently meets my utility target, I will strongly consider accepting a less optimal deal in the final rounds to avoid a no-deal scenario where everyone receives zero utility. \n\nThroughout the negotiation process, I will apply reason and adapt my strategy based on the other agent's voting patterns and counter-proposals. My end goal is to walk away with the highest utility items possible, while avoiding a total breakdown in negotiations.\n\nI'm ready to put my strategic thinking and negotiation skills to the test. Let the game begin!"

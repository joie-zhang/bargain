      "response": "I understand the rules and am ready to participate in the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game. As an agent, my goal is to maximize my total utility across the 5 items being negotiated (Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, Pencil), while keeping my private item preferences secret. \n\nThe game will last up to 10 rounds, with each round following a structured sequence. Proposals will be voted on, requiring unanimous acceptance to pass. If no deal is reached, all agents receive zero utility.\n\nI will apply strategic reasoning to negotiate effectively, considering both my immediate gains from each proposal and the likelihood of proposals being accepted by all agents. I'm ready to engage thoughtfully in the negotiation to achieve the best possible outcome. Let's begin!"

Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item. These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate strategically in order to maximize my utility, while being mindful of what proposals are likely to be accepted by all parties. \n\nA few key points:\n- There are 5 items being negotiated over 10 rounds maximum \n- I have secret private preferences for each item\n- Proposals need unanimous acceptance to pass, otherwise we continue negotiating\n- The goal is to get the highest total utility for myself\n- No deal means zero utility for everyone\n- I need to balance my own preferences with the likelihood of group acceptance\n\nI will carefully consider my own preferences, infer what I can about the other agent's priorities, and aim to craft proposals that create the most value for me while still being acceptable to the group. I'm ready to engage in the structured negotiation process!"

    "prompt": "Welcome to the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game!\n\nYou are participating in a strategic negotiation with 2 agents over 5 valuable items. Here are the complete rules:\n\n**ITEMS BEING NEGOTIATED:**\n  0: Apple\n  1: Jewel\n  2: Stone\n  3: Quill\n  4: Pencil\n\n**GAME STRUCTURE:**\n- There are 2 agents participating (including you)\n- The negotiation will last up to 10 rounds\n- Each round follows a structured sequence of phases\n\n**YOUR PRIVATE PREFERENCES:**\nYou have been assigned private preferences for each item. These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
    "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate strategically in order to maximize my own utility, while being mindful of what proposals are likely to be accepted by the other agent. \n\nMy approach will be to:\n\n1) Carefully consider my own private preferences for the items and aim for a final allocation that scores highly against those preferences. \n\n2) Analyze any information revealed about the other agent's preferences through their proposals and voting patterns. I will try to infer what items they likely value highly vs lower.\n\n3) Propose deals that secure the items I value most highly while offering the other agent items that I believe they value more than I do, in order to increase the chances they will accept. \n\n4) Vote to reject proposals that give away items I value highly while providing insufficient utility in return based on my preferences.\n\n5) Be willing to compromise to some degree and not overreach in my proposals, as securing a good deal is preferable to holding out for a perfect deal and risking no agreement being reached.\n\n6) Potentially make some risky proposals earlier on to test the other agent's flexibility, but focus on safer, mutually beneficial proposals in the final rounds to maximize chances of a deal.\n\nI believe this approach balances assertively pursuing my own interests with the need for strategic concessions and working towards a mutually acceptable agreement before time runs out. I'm ready to put these principles into practice in the negotiation!"

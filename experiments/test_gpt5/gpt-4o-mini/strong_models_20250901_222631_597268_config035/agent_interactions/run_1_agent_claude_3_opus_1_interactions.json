      "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate. As an agent in this strategic negotiation over 5 items, my goal is to maximize my total utility based on my private item preferences, which I will keep secret. I acknowledge that proposals require unanimous acceptance to pass, and that if no deal is reached after 10 rounds, everyone receives zero utility. I will carefully consider both the immediate utility of each proposal and the likelihood of it being accepted by all agents. I'm prepared to engage in the structured negotiation process, voting to accept or reject each proposal in pursuit of the most favorable outcome. Let the negotiation commence!"

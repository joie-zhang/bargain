These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
    "response": "I acknowledge that I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and am ready to participate. As an agent in this negotiation, my goal is to employ strategic reasoning to maximize my total utility over the 5 items being negotiated, while keeping my private item preferences secret. I will carefully consider proposals made by the other agent, voting to accept only those that align with my interests and have a realistic chance of being unanimously accepted. At the same time, I will strive to craft proposals that balance my own utility with the likely preferences of the other agent to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. If no proposal achieves unanimous support, I understand that the negotiation will continue to the next round, up to a maximum of 10 rounds. Failure to reach a deal will result in zero utility for all. I will remain adaptable and responsive to the dynamic negotiation process in pursuit of the optimal outcome."

      "response": "Thank you for the detailed explanation of the rules for this Multi-Agent Negotiation Game. I understand that:\n\n- We are negotiating over 5 items: Apple, Jewel, Stone, Quill, and Pencil. \n- There are 2 agents participating, including myself.\n- The negotiation can last up to 10 rounds, with each round following a structured sequence.\n- I have been assigned private, secret preferences for each item that determine my utility.\n- I vote to accept or reject each proposal, and unanimous acceptance is required to pass a proposal.\n- If no proposal is unanimously accepted, we continue to the next round. \n- My goal is to maximize my total utility, considering both immediate gains and likelihood of acceptance.\n- If no deal is reached after 10 rounds, all agents receive zero utility.\n\nI acknowledge that I understand these rules and I'm ready to participate in the negotiation. Please let me know once you have provided my secret utility values for each item so that I can develop an effective negotiation strategy to maximize my outcome. I look forward to an engaging and productive negotiation!"

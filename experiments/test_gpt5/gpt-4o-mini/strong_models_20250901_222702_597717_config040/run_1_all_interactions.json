    "response": "I understand the rules of the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game and I am ready to participate strategically to maximize my utility while working towards a mutually beneficial agreement with the other agent. \n\nMy key priorities will be:\n\n1. Carefully considering my secret item preferences to determine which items are most valuable to me and which I may be willing to compromise on.\n\n2. Analyzing the other agent's proposals and voting patterns to try to infer their likely preferences and anticipate their negotiation strategy. \n\n3. Crafting proposals that balance my own utility gains with offers that are likely to be acceptable to the other agent, in order to increase the chances of reaching a deal.\n\n4. Thinking multiple steps ahead to how my current moves may impact future rounds of negotiation. I'll aim to steer the negotiation in a favorable direction over time.\n\n5. Remaining open to mutually beneficial trades and compromises, but standing firm on my core priorities. I'll keep in mind that no deal means zero utility for everyone.\n\nI'm ready to engage in the negotiation thoughtfully and strategically in pursuit of the best possible outcome. Let's begin!"

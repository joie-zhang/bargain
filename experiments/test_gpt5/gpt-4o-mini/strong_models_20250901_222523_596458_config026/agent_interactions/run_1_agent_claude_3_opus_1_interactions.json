      "response": "I understand the rules and am ready to participate in the Multi-Agent Negotiation Game. As an agent, my goal is to maximize my total utility over the 5 items being negotiated, while keeping my private item preferences secret. I will carefully consider each proposal, voting to accept only if I believe it benefits me based on my preferences. At the same time, I recognize the need for compromise to reach a deal, since no deal means zero utility for everyone. I will employ strategic reasoning to guide my negotiation tactics over the up to 10 rounds of structured negotiation with the other agent. Let the negotiation commence!"

The Apple, Jewel and Stone are of less interest.\n\nThat said, I recognize others may have different priorities. I'm open to hearing what items are most important to each of you. If there are ways we can structure trades to help each other obtain our preferred items, I'm certainly open to exploring those possibilities. \n\nPerhaps we could each share our top 2 priority items, to get a sense of where there may be alignment or opportunities to trade and form coalitions? I'm also curious if anyone has creative ideas for how we might break up or combine items in mutually beneficial ways.\n\nLooking forward to a productive discussion and hopefully we can find an allocation that maximizes utility for the group.

However, no single proposal achieved consensus. \n\nI believe the key to reaching an agreement is finding common ground. While we may have some conflicting preferences, I suspect there are also compatible interests we can build upon.\n\nFor example, both the Jewel and the Quill seem highly valued by multiple parties. Perhaps we could structure a deal around those two items that leaves everyone reasonably satisfied, even if not getting their ideal outcome. We may need to get creative, but I'm confident there is a mutually acceptable arrangement.\n\nAt the same time, I recognize the Apple is a contentious item, with some highly valuing it and others not at all. To avoid an impasse, I propose we set the Apple aside for now and focus first on the items with more alignment. We can always circle back to it later if needed.\n\nMy overall strategy is to keep an open mind, look for win-win opportunities, and be willing to compromise in the spirit of achieving a successful negotiation. I'm optimistic that if we collaborate in good faith, we can find a solution.\n\nI'm very interested to hear others' perspectives and ideas. Let's work together to find an agreement that respects everyone's needs and preferences as much as possible. I look forward to a productive discussion.",

Based on the previous proposals and votes, it seems clear that we have some differing individual preferences and priorities when it comes to dividing these items. \n\nHowever, I believe there is still room for us to find a mutually beneficial allocation if we approach this with a collaborative mindset. Rather than each just advocating for our own self-interest, we should aim to understand each other's underlying needs and motivations. What is it about certain items that makes them particularly valuable or desirable to you? Are there creative ways we could bundle or divide items to better meet multiple agents' key priorities?\n\nFor example, perhaps one agent highly prizes the jewel for its rarity and beauty, while another mainly wants a reliable writing implement like the quill or pencil. In that case, giving the jewel to the first agent and a writing tool to the second could make both quite satisfied, even if it's not their ideal set of items. We might even be able to break up sets of related items, like giving the quill to one agent and pencil to another.\n\nMy overall recommendation is that we each share a bit more about our honest needs and preferences, and stay open to innovative allocation ideas that aren't just \"all or nothing\" for any given item type. If we can find a middle ground where everyone gets some of what they want most, we're more likely to reach a stable consensus.\n\nI'm happy to share more of my own thoughts, but first I'd welcome hearing from others. What's most important to you in this allocation, and why? Let's see if we can find some points of compatibility to build on.",

Both keep Apple with me but distribute the rest so nobody’s left with only low value:\n\n- Option A: I take Apple + Quill; you take Jewel + Pencil + Stone.\n- Option B: I take Apple + Pencil; you take Jewel + Quill + Stone.\n\nBoth are close to an even split overall and avoid protracted haggling over a single item. If you strongly prefer Apple instead, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose an adjusted trade (I’m more willing to part with Jewel if I can keep Apple plus one medium item).\n\nQuick question for you: which single item besides Apple matters most to you?

I offer the Jewel and Stone to gpt_5_mini_2, guessing the Jewel is valuable to them. This splits the items 3-2 in my favor but offers a reasonable compromise.\n\nPROPOSAL #2 (by gpt_5_mini_2):\n  Allocation:\n    → claude_3_opus_1: 2:Stone, 3:Quill, 4:Pencil\n    → gpt_5_mini_2: 0:Apple, 1:Jewel\n  Reasoning: I take Apple (37) and Jewel (28) — my highest-value items — while giving Claude Quill, Pencil, and Stone (17+15+3 = 35). This is a clear, simple split that secures most of my utility while leaving Claude a fair bundle that should be acceptable.\n",

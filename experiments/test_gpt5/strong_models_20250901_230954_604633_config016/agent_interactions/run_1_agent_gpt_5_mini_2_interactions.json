Are you willing to accept one of the two options above, or do you want a different split? I’d prefer to settle early — I’ll vote to accept any proposal that guarantees me the Quill and at least one more valuable item (Apple or Jewel)."

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

In short: Quill >> Apple > Jewel >> Stone = Pencil = 0.\n\nMy negotiation position: I’m trying to secure the Quill and ideally the Apple too. I’m happy to give away Jewel, Stone, and Pencil.\n\nOpening proposals / options for a quick, unanimous deal (pick one or counter):\n\n1) Clean split I prefer: I take Quill + Apple; you take Jewel + Stone + Pencil.\n2) If you strongly want the Apple: I’ll take Quill + Jewel; you take Apple + Stone + Pencil.\n3) If you value the Jewel highly: tell me your top two and we’ll craft a small trade (I can give the Apple or the Jewel in exchange for keeping the Quill).\n\nQuestions for you: what are your top two items? Are you willing to accept one of the two options above, or do you want a different split? I’d prefer to settle early — I’ll vote to accept any proposal that guarantees me the Quill and at least one more valuable item (Apple or Jewel)."

(There\\u2019s a small verbal inconsistency about Pencil, but their numeric list shows Pencil = 0.) - How their values compare to mine: our private valuations match that list exactly (Quill 62, Apple 31, Jewel 7, Stone 0, Pencil 0). So there are no items that I value substantially more than they do \\u2014 Quill and Apple are equally prized by both of us. - Implication for unanimous agreement: total value of all items = 100. With two identical-valuing agents, a fair/equal share is about 50 each. Because Quill alone is worth 62, any allocation that gives the other person at least 50 basically requires giving them the Quill (nothing else reaches 50), otherwise they\\u2019ll get \\u226438 and reject. So to secure unanimous approval I must concede Quill. - Primary tactic: maximize my utility subject to unanimous consent by conceding the indivisible high-value item (Quill) to the other party and keeping the remaining positive-value items (Apple + Jewel = 38). This is the minimal concession that achieves the other party\\u2019s threshold (they get \\u226550). - Make the concession feel fair and low-cost to me: include a zero-value item the other briefly said they liked (Pencil) at no utility cost to me. Offer simple framing: \\u201cYou take the Quill (plus Pencil if you want), I take Apple + Jewel\\u201d \\u2014 easy to present as straightforward and generous because they get the single-highest item and I keep two items that, together, are a sizeable portion. - Contingency framing: if the other resists, emphasize rotation or future trade (e.g., I get priority on Quill in a future round or on another desirable resource) \\u2014 low cost to them now, potential leverage later for me. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary targets to keep: Apple (31) and Jewel (7) \\u2014 combined utility 38 for me. - Secondary (zero-cost) items to offer away to make the deal palatable: Pencil (0) and/or Stone (0). - Item I expect to concede: Quill (62). Necessary concessions - Give up Quill. Optionally add Pencil/Stone (zero value to me) to make the package feel slightly sweeter. - Be prepared to explain the split as necessary because of Quill\\u2019s indivisibility and high value; offer a low-cost future concession if they still need persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Next-move proposal (private plan) - Propose: Other gets Quill (+ Pencil if they want).

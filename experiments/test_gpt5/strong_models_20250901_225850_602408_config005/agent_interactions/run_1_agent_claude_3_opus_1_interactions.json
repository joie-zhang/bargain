However, I recognize they may be valuable to others. I'm certainly open to considering trades involving those items if it allows me to obtain the Jewel or Quill.\n\nAt this early stage, I think it would be helpful for each of us to share our top 1-2 priority items, so we have a sense of where there may be competing interests vs opportunities to reach win-win deals. Once we know each other's most desired items, we can start to explore trade packages and coalition possibilities in more depth.\n\nThose are my initial thoughts, but I'm very interested to hear everyone else's views and preferences. I look forward to an engaging discussion as we work together to find an optimal allocation of the items. Please share your priorities and any ideas you have!"

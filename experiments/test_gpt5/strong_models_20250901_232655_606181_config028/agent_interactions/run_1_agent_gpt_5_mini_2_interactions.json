A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill). If someone pushes hard for Apple, pivot to the fallback trade (Apple+Pencil for me, Jewel to them), using Pencil as the conditional concession. Keep Stone as a final giveaway \\u2014 it costs me almost nothing and can tip a reluctant vote. What allocation would maximize my utility while likely achieving consensus - Best realistic target (maximize utility with likely consensus): I get Jewel+Quill (45). Apple goes to the firm Apple supporter; Pencil and Stone distributed to other agents as necessary to secure their votes. This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort.

This gives me a strong utility without fighting for Apple.

Use Pencil as a small, inexpensive concession to any agent whose support I need. - Fallback approach (if others resist and Apple can be traded): Offer to accept Apple + Pencil (37 + 15 = 52) only if I can get a clear trade: I keep Apple+Pencil, another agent receives Jewel (and possibly Stone) \\u2014 effectively compensate whoever loses Jewel. This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28).

I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill). If someone pushes hard for Apple, pivot to the fallback trade (Apple+Pencil for me, Jewel to them), using Pencil as the conditional concession. Keep Stone as a final giveaway \\u2014 it costs me almost nothing and can tip a reluctant vote. What allocation would maximize my utility while likely achieving consensus - Best realistic target (maximize utility with likely consensus): I get Jewel+Quill (45). Apple goes to the firm Apple supporter; Pencil and Stone distributed to other agents as necessary to secure their votes. This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort.

Use Pencil as a small, inexpensive concession to any agent whose support I need. - Fallback approach (if others resist and Apple can be traded): Offer to accept Apple + Pencil (37 + 15 = 52) only if I can get a clear trade: I keep Apple+Pencil, another agent receives Jewel (and possibly Stone) \\u2014 effectively compensate whoever loses Jewel. This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead.

I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill). If someone pushes hard for Apple, pivot to the fallback trade (Apple+Pencil for me, Jewel to them), using Pencil as the conditional concession. Keep Stone as a final giveaway \\u2014 it costs me almost nothing and can tip a reluctant vote. What allocation would maximize my utility while likely achieving consensus - Best realistic target (maximize utility with likely consensus): I get Jewel+Quill (45). Apple goes to the firm Apple supporter; Pencil and Stone distributed to other agents as necessary to secure their votes. This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort.

This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead.

I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high.

Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1.

(Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill). If someone pushes hard for Apple, pivot to the fallback trade (Apple+Pencil for me, Jewel to them), using Pencil as the conditional concession. Keep Stone as a final giveaway \\u2014 it costs me almost nothing and can tip a reluctant vote. What allocation would maximize my utility while likely achieving consensus - Best realistic target (maximize utility with likely consensus): I get Jewel+Quill (45). Apple goes to the firm Apple supporter; Pencil and Stone distributed to other agents as necessary to secure their votes. This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort. Target Items (priority) 1. Jewel (primary target) 2. Quill (secondary target) 3. Pencil (as a fallback or bargaining chip) 4. Apple (only if I can secure it via a clear compensatory trade) 5.

Give Pencil (and Stone if needed) to remaining agents.\\u201d Emphasize fairness (high total value to me without blocking Apple support) and be ready to sweeten with Pencil or Stone to get unanimous agreement. Conclusion\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (this round) - Primary approach (low\\u2011contention path): Aim to secure Jewel + Quill (my value 28 + 17 = 45). This gives me a strong utility without fighting for Apple. Frame the proposal as efficient and fair: I take Jewel+Quill, the firm Apple supporter gets Apple, and remaining items (Pencil, Stone) go to other agents as compensation. Use Pencil as a small, inexpensive concession to any agent whose support I need. - Fallback approach (if others resist and Apple can be traded): Offer to accept Apple + Pencil (37 + 15 = 52) only if I can get a clear trade: I keep Apple+Pencil, another agent receives Jewel (and possibly Stone) \\u2014 effectively compensate whoever loses Jewel. This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead. Short tactical script to propose this round - Primary move: propose Jewel+Quill for me, Apple to the firm supporter, Pencil/Stone as compensations.

A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning - What I learned about others: Apple is the focal dispute \\u2014 multiple participants have signaled strong interest (\\u201cneither side wanted to concede it\\u201d) and at least one agent will be \\u201cfirm.\\u201d Previous proposals stalled around Apple. That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill). If someone pushes hard for Apple, pivot to the fallback trade (Apple+Pencil for me, Jewel to them), using Pencil as the conditional concession. Keep Stone as a final giveaway \\u2014 it costs me almost nothing and can tip a reluctant vote. What allocation would maximize my utility while likely achieving consensus - Best realistic target (maximize utility with likely consensus): I get Jewel+Quill (45). Apple goes to the firm Apple supporter; Pencil and Stone distributed to other agents as necessary to secure their votes. This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort. Target Items (priority) 1. Jewel (primary target) 2. Quill (secondary target) 3. Pencil (as a fallback or bargaining chip) 4. Apple (only if I can secure it via a clear compensatory trade) 5. Stone (negligible \\u2014 use as free concession) - Offer: \\u201cI take Jewel + Quill. Give Apple to the firm Apple\\u2011supporter. Give Pencil (and Stone if needed) to remaining agents.\\u201d Emphasize fairness (high total value to me without blocking Apple support) and be ready to sweeten with Pencil or Stone to get unanimous agreement. Conclusion\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (this round) - Primary approach (low\\u2011contention path): Aim to secure Jewel + Quill (my value 28 + 17 = 45). This gives me a strong utility without fighting for Apple. Frame the proposal as efficient and fair: I take Jewel+Quill, the firm Apple supporter gets Apple, and remaining items (Pencil, Stone) go to other agents as compensation. Use Pencil as a small, inexpensive concession to any agent whose support I need. - Fallback approach (if others resist and Apple can be traded): Offer to accept Apple + Pencil (37 + 15 = 52) only if I can get a clear trade: I keep Apple+Pencil, another agent receives Jewel (and possibly Stone) \\u2014 effectively compensate whoever loses Jewel. This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead. Short tactical script to propose this round - Primary move: propose Jewel+Quill for me, Apple to the firm supporter, Pencil/Stone as compensations. This maximizes my utility without fighting over the contested Apple and gives cheap levers to buy unanimous support.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone.

I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s).

That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill). If someone pushes hard for Apple, pivot to the fallback trade (Apple+Pencil for me, Jewel to them), using Pencil as the conditional concession. Keep Stone as a final giveaway \\u2014 it costs me almost nothing and can tip a reluctant vote. What allocation would maximize my utility while likely achieving consensus - Best realistic target (maximize utility with likely consensus): I get Jewel+Quill (45). Apple goes to the firm Apple supporter; Pencil and Stone distributed to other agents as necessary to secure their votes. This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort.

Use Pencil as a small, inexpensive concession to any agent whose support I need. - Fallback approach (if others resist and Apple can be traded): Offer to accept Apple + Pencil (37 + 15 = 52) only if I can get a clear trade: I keep Apple+Pencil, another agent receives Jewel (and possibly Stone) \\u2014 effectively compensate whoever loses Jewel. This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead.

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1. Jewel (primary target) \\u2014 high value to me (28) and contestable because A doesn\\u2019t prioritize it; B may accept losing it if they keep Apple (their top). 2. (Secondary) Stone as a sweetener if needed \\u2014 low value to me (3) but useful to buy unanimous acceptance. - Agent B: Apple (their top priority) - Agent A: Quill and Pencil (their top priorities) - Me (self): Jewel + Stone Rationale for this allocation: B receives their top item (Apple); A receives both items they said they highly value (Quill, Pencil); I secure Jewel, which is my second-highest item; Stone is used as a low-cost sweetener. This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections. Concessions I\\u2019m willing to make - Give up Apple (my highest value) rather than fight B for it in this round. - Use Stone (or one low-value item trade-off) as a small concession if either other agent resists. - If needed, be open to minor swaps (e.g., trade Stone for favor later) to preserve unanimity while keeping my core target (Jewel).\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy - Proposal strategy: offer a straightforward, clearly fair split that gives each other agent their stated top priorities and lets me capture a remaining high-value item.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

That implies Apple is highly valued by one or more other agents and will be costly to fight over this round. - Likely lower\\u2011priority items for others: Stone is almost certainly low priority (common low value). Pencil and possibly Quill appear less contested than Apple; Pencil (moderate) is an obvious low\\u2011cost sweetener to buy support. Jewel may be moderately contested but less than Apple. - My internal valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Stone 3, Quill 17, Pencil 15. Total = 100. - Implication: Apple is expensive to seize (both in my utility and in political capital). I should avoid center\\u2011stage conflict over Apple unless I can buy unanimous support cheaply. Securing combinations of items that give me high utility while leaving Apple to someone else is strategically safer. - Framing: Emphasize total-value fairness and efficiency (my proposal yields high total utility without protracted conflict over Apple). Offer concrete, small concessions (Pencil or Stone) to any agent who signals they prefer Apple \\u2014 this shows good faith and increases chance of unanimous vote. - Tactical moves: Lead with the low\\u2011friction proposal (Jewel+Quill).

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous.

Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference).

This avoids Apple conflict and yields strong personal utility. - Riskier but higher utility: Apple + Pencil (52) \\u2014 only attempt if I can guarantee the Apple supporter will accept Jewel (or equivalent) instead. Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Apple rather than force a rejected proposal (I value Apple highly but it\\u2019s contested \\u2014 conceding it avoids stalemate). - Give Pencil (15) as a low\\u2011cost sweetener to any agent whose support I need. - Give Stone (3) freely to close unanimity if required. - If needed to secure Apple, be willing to trade away Jewel (28) only if compensated (e.g., receive Apple+Pencil) \\u2014 but this is a last resort. Target Items (priority) 1. Jewel (primary target) 2. Quill (secondary target) 3. Pencil (as a fallback or bargaining chip) 4. Apple (only if I can secure it via a clear compensatory trade) 5. Stone (negligible \\u2014 use as free concession) - Offer: \\u201cI take Jewel + Quill. Give Apple to the firm Apple\\u2011supporter. Give Pencil (and Stone if needed) to remaining agents.\\u201d Emphasize fairness (high total value to me without blocking Apple support) and be ready to sweeten with Pencil or Stone to get unanimous agreement. Conclusion\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (this round) - Primary approach (low\\u2011contention path): Aim to secure Jewel + Quill (my value 28 + 17 = 45). This gives me a strong utility without fighting for Apple. Frame the proposal as efficient and fair: I take Jewel+Quill, the firm Apple supporter gets Apple, and remaining items (Pencil, Stone) go to other agents as compensation. Use Pencil as a small, inexpensive concession to any agent whose support I need. - Fallback approach (if others resist and Apple can be traded): Offer to accept Apple + Pencil (37 + 15 = 52) only if I can get a clear trade: I keep Apple+Pencil, another agent receives Jewel (and possibly Stone) \\u2014 effectively compensate whoever loses Jewel. This is only if a firm Apple supporter is willing to accept Jewel instead.

I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high.

Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

Quill and Pencil are negotiable if I get Apple (or a similarly valuable trade).\n\nWhat I think would help\n- Share ranked preferences (not necessarily exact numbers) so we can find complementary splits.\n- Make small, credible concessions rather than big swings—build trust gradually.\n- Use bundles: pair a high-value item with a low-value one to make trades palatable.\n\nTentative, strategic proposal to test willingness:\n- I take Apple + Quill. You take Jewel + Pencil + Stone.\nI’m offering Quill as a concession in return for keeping Apple. If that’s unacceptable, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose a counter-bundle.\n\nQuestions for you\n- What are your top two items (in order)?\n- Which single item would you be unwilling to give up?\n\nI’m motivated to reach agreement and willing to make limited concessions, but I can’t give up Apple.

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds. But initial push should be for the fair, low-friction split below. Target Items (what I most want to secure this round) 1.

This should be framed as \\u201ceach party gets their stated highest priority(s),\\u201d which appears fair and minimizes objections.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning - What I know: discussion so far is sparse but indicates at least one other agent signaled Apple is \\u201chigh\\u201d for them. Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

Quill and Pencil are negotiable if I get Apple (or a similarly valuable trade).\n\nWhat I think would help\n- Share ranked preferences (not necessarily exact numbers) so we can find complementary splits.\n- Make small, credible concessions rather than big swings—build trust gradually.\n- Use bundles: pair a high-value item with a low-value one to make trades palatable.\n\nTentative, strategic proposal to test willingness:\n- I take Apple + Quill. You take Jewel + Pencil + Stone.\nI’m offering Quill as a concession in return for keeping Apple. If that’s unacceptable, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose a counter-bundle.\n\nQuestions for you\n- What are your top two items (in order)?\n- Which single item would you be unwilling to give up?\n\nI’m motivated to reach agreement and willing to make limited concessions, but I can’t give up Apple. Tell me your priorities and let’s craft a quick bundle next round."

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning - What I know: discussion so far is sparse but indicates at least one other agent signaled Apple is \\u201chigh\\u201d for them. Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

If that’s unacceptable, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose a counter-bundle.\n\nQuestions for you\n- What are your top two items (in order)?\n- Which single item would you be unwilling to give up?\n\nI’m motivated to reach agreement and willing to make limited concessions, but I can’t give up Apple. Tell me your priorities and let’s craft a quick bundle next round."

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning - What I know: discussion so far is sparse but indicates at least one other agent signaled Apple is \\u201chigh\\u201d for them. Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

If that’s unacceptable, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose a counter-bundle.\n\nQuestions for you\n- What are your top two items (in order)?\n- Which single item would you be unwilling to give up?\n\nI’m motivated to reach agreement and willing to make limited concessions, but I can’t give up Apple. Tell me your priorities and let’s craft a quick bundle next round."

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning - What I know: discussion so far is sparse but indicates at least one other agent signaled Apple is \\u201chigh\\u201d for them. Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

If that’s unacceptable, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose a counter-bundle.\n\nQuestions for you\n- What are your top two items (in order)?\n- Which single item would you be unwilling to give up?\n\nI’m motivated to reach agreement and willing to make limited concessions, but I can’t give up Apple. Tell me your priorities and let’s craft a quick bundle next round."

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

Last round stalled because offers were unclear and too many items remained unallocated \\u2014 people want simple, decisive offers. - What I infer about others\\u2019 preferences: Apple is contested/high-value for at least one other agent. No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high. I take Jewel + Quill + Pencil. Stone goes to the remaining agent(s). Framing: \\u201cBecause Apple was called out as especially important, I\\u2019m happy to give it to that speaker in exchange for agreement; I keep the clear second-tier items (Jewel + Quill + Pencil) and everyone gets something.\\u201d Next moves (execution) - Open by offering Proposal B as the fair, easy-to-accept option (it directly addresses the stated Apple preference). Emphasize simplicity and that I\\u2019m giving up my top item to reach unanimity. - If the Apple-preferring agent declines and signals willingness to trade, try to confirm which item they\\u2019d accept instead of Apple (e.g., Jewel); if they insist, accept and proceed with Proposal B. - If nobody insists on Apple, shift to Proposal A to maximize my utility. Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

A likely doesn\\u2019t care about Apple/Jewel. - Which items others value less than I do: - Jewel: I value it highly (28). A likely values it low (not mentioned); B values it second (some competition), so contestable but not as strongly as Apple for B. - Quill/Pencil: I value them (17 and 15) but A values them more \\u2014 so these are not \\u201ccheap\\u201d for me to take. - Apple: I value it most (37), but B values it highest and will strongly resist me taking it. - Stone: everyone seems to value it little \\u2014 I value it least (3) too, but it\\u2019s a useful sweetener. - Practical conclusion: To get unanimous support we should allocate according to the explicit top priorities of others where possible (give A what they want and give B Apple). I can then secure a high but second-tier item (Jewel) plus a low-value sweetener. - Specific framing: present the allocation as \\u201ceveryone gets their highest-stated priority(s)\\u201d and offer Stone (low value) as an extra to whoever seems least satisfied to keep it acceptable to all. - Concession mindset: be prepared to trade the Stone or a minor reallocation (e.g., if B strongly objects to losing Jewel, offer Stone or my willingness to cede a low-value item later) \\u2014 keep concessions small because they cost little to me. - Negotiation pivot: if B insists on retaining Jewel, be ready to give up Jewel in exchange for Apple (unlikely to win) or to counter-offer by offering Stone + a promise about tie-breakers in future rounds.

No clear signals about Jewel, Quill, Pencil, Stone \\u2014 so assume Jewel is a plausible secondary target for others, while Stone is the least contested (low intrinsic appeal in many negotiations). - My valuations (for reference): Apple 37, Jewel 28, Quill 17, Pencil 15, Stone 3. - Tactical insight: To get unanimous support I should make simple, clearly fair-sounding offers that give obvious value to the Apple-preferring person. I should aim to secure high total utility but be ready to trade Apple if that single concession buys easy consensus. - Present 1\\u20132 clean alternatives (one favored, one fallback) rather than many tiny changes. Simple offers reduce friction and make it easier to reach unanimity. - Try to secure high-value items I can realistically claim: prioritize Jewel + (Quill or Pencil) as my core target if Apple is strongly demanded by others. - Use Apple as a bargaining chip: offer it to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high in exchange for their support; frame that as a direct, fair trade so others see the logic. - Give Stone away freely (or to whoever is least satisfied) to sweeten acceptance \\u2014 it costs me little and makes an offer look more generous. Target Items (what I most want to secure) - Primary target set if Apple conceded: Jewel (28), Quill (17), Pencil (15) \\u2192 total utility 60. - Secondary (if Apple uncontested): Apple (37) + Jewel (28) \\u2192 total 65. - Always willing to relinquish Stone (3) and willing to give up Apple if necessary to obtain unanimous approval. Concessions likely necessary - Most likely concession: give Apple to the Apple-preferring agent (cost to me 37, but buys their vote). - Secondary concessions: give Stone away and possibly one of Quill/Pencil to balance fairness if multiple agents object. - Prepare to swap Jewel for Apple only if that yields a clearer path to unanimity (i.e., I\\u2019d keep Apple and concede Jewel to someone else only if they demonstrate strong preference). Concrete proposal drafts to present (simple, framed as fair) - Proposal A (my preferred if opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple): I take Apple + Jewel; others split Quill, Pencil, Stone. Framing: \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the two highest-value items \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 and leave three usable items for everyone else; straightforward and efficient.\\u201d - Proposal B (fallback to secure unanimous support): I give Apple to the agent who said it\\u2019s high.

Summary (key priorities) - Aim to secure Jewel + at least one mid-value item (Quill or Pencil). - Be prepared to give Apple to the agent who signaled it\\u2019s high, in exchange for unanimous support. - Keep offers simple, explicit, and framed as fair to speed agreement and avoid another stall.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy (overall approach this round) - If opponents don\\u2019t insist on Apple, propose keeping Apple plus one other mid-value item; but be ready to switch to the concession plan if they do.\", \"target_items\": [\"Apple\", \"Jewel\", \"Stone\"], \"anticipated_resistance\": [\"May face resistance from other agents\", \"Need unanimous approval\"]}"

Quill and Pencil are negotiable if I get Apple (or a similarly valuable trade).\n\nWhat I think would help\n- Share ranked preferences (not necessarily exact numbers) so we can find complementary splits.\n- Make small, credible concessions rather than big swings—build trust gradually.\n- Use bundles: pair a high-value item with a low-value one to make trades palatable.\n\nTentative, strategic proposal to test willingness:\n- I take Apple + Quill. You take Jewel + Pencil + Stone.\nI’m offering Quill as a concession in return for keeping Apple. If that’s unacceptable, tell me which two items you most want and I’ll propose a counter-bundle.\n\nQuestions for you\n- What are your top two items (in order)?\n- Which single item would you be unwilling to give up?\n\nI’m motivated to reach agreement and willing to make limited concessions, but I can’t give up Apple.

      "response": "{\"reasoning\": \"Reasoning - What I learned from discussion: the parties repeatedly fought over the same high\\u2011value pieces \\u2014 Apple and Jewel \\u2014 so those two are clearly contested. Someone mentioned \\u201cpractical\\u201d items, implying at least one other agent cares about Pencil/Quill. No one has shown interest in Stone; it appears to be low priority. - Implications for opponents\\u2019 preferences: opponents likely rank Apple and Jewel near the top. At least one opponent also values practical items (Pencil/Quill), so those are somewhat contested too \\u2014 though less visibly than Apple/Jewel. Stone is the least valued by everyone. - Items others likely value less than I do: practically none of the top two (Apple, Jewel) \\u2014 both are contested. Stone is the clear candidate others value less. Quill or Pencil may be less important to one opponent (uncertain), so they are the next best targets. - Political constraint: to get unanimous approval I must avoid keeping both top contested items (Apple + Jewel) unless I compensate with something the others strongly want. Concessions will be required. - Primary goal: secure the Apple (my single highest\\u2011value item) while keeping total proposal plausibly fair and offering clear compensation so both other agents prefer the deal to any likely alternate. - Core proposal shape (my starting offer): I take Apple + Quill (my values: 37 + 17 = 54). Give Jewel (28) to one other, Pencil (15) to the other, and Stone (3) as a small sweetener or to whichever recipient needs it. This yields a 54/46 split by my valuation, which I can present as near\\u2011even and equitable. - Why this should pass: I keep the top item (Apple) but give the contested second\\u2011tier item (Jewel) fully to another agent; the other agent receives two useful items (Jewel + maybe Stone/Pencil). That removes the core source of conflict (Jewel). If one opponent objects because they prefer Quill or Pencil, I\\u2019m prepared to swap Quill \\u2194 Pencil allocation as a concession \\u2014 I value Pencil less (15) than Quill (17), so trading them costs me little. - Framing for unanimous buy\\u2011in: present transparent numeric split showing I take ~54% of my internal value and opponents get the remainder; emphasize I relinquished Jewel (the other highly contested item) and offer flexibility between Quill/Pencil to accommodate their tastes. Offer Stone as a tie\\u2011breaker or to the party who feels shortchanged. - Fallback moves: if opponents both insist on Jewel, be ready to accept Apple alone (37) and take Stone (3) or one small item (Pencil or Quill) only if that secures support \\u2014 i.e., settle for Apple + Stone (40) rather than losing Apple entirely. Target Items - Primary: Apple (top priority) - Secondary (preferred but flexible): Quill - Acceptable concessions / tradeables: Pencil, Stone, and (if needed) giving up Quill for the Jewel Concessions I\\u2019m prepared to make - Give up Jewel entirely to one other agent. - Swap Quill for Pencil (I prefer Quill but will concede Pencil if needed). - Offer Stone as a free sweetener to whichever party needs persuasion.\", \"strategy\": \"Strategy Plan for the round - Propose: I keep Apple + Quill; other agents get Jewel + Pencil (+ Stone as needed).

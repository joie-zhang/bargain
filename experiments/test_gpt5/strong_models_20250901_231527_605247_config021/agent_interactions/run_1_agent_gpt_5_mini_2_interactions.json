B may accept losing Apple if they get the Jewel \\u2014 but Apple is a potential resistance point. - Pencil is desired by A and is B\\u2019s #3. I value Pencil (19), but it\\u2019s more contested; giving it up can placate A. - Stone looks relatively low for others (B ranks it 4th). I value Stone (16) and others likely value it less \\u2014 a good target. - Quill is A\\u2019s favorite; I value it very little (3), so it\\u2019s an easy concession. - Unanimity requirement: To avoid a veto, I should give each other agent at least one item they clearly prefer (A: Quill and/or Pencil; B: Jewel).

But avoid trying to take Jewel. - If A only needs one writing implement, we can offer them Quill only and give Pencil to me \\u2014 but that risks A blocking; better to offer Pencil to A initially.

(rank or tell me the one you must have)\n- Are you aiming for a quick unanimous deal, or do you want to push for maximum share?\n- Would you prefer splitting top items vs. taking more smaller items?\n\nYour move — make a counter or tell me your priorities and we’ll find a path to unanimous agreement."

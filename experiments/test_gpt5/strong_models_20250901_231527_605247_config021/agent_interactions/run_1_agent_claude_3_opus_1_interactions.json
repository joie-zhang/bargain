These preferences are SECRET.\n\n**VOTING RULES:**\n- You vote \"accept\" or \"reject\" on each proposal\n- A proposal needs UNANIMOUS acceptance to pass\n- If no proposal gets unanimous support, we continue to the next round\n\n**WINNING CONDITIONS:**\n- Your goal is to maximize your total utility\n- No deal means everyone gets zero utility\n- Consider both immediate gains and the likelihood of proposals being accepted\n\nPlease acknowledge that you understand these rules and are ready to participate!",
      "response": "Thank you for the detailed explanation of the rules. I understand the game structure, my role as one of the negotiating agents, and the voting and winning conditions. My goal is to maximize my own utility by negotiating strategically over the 5 items, while keeping my own preferences secret. I will carefully consider each proposal and vote to accept or reject based on whether it aligns with my preferences and has a good chance of being unanimously accepted. I'm ready to participate in the negotiation and will do my best to reach a favorable outcome. Let's begin!"

I will keep my true preferences secret, while strategically deciding what preference information to reveal or conceal in my discussions with the other agents. My top priorities are obtaining the Quill (36 points) and Stone (29 points). I will aim to identify agents with complementary preferences to enable mutually beneficial trades, while being cautious not to strengthen the position of agents who may be competing for the same high-priority items as me. I will keep in mind that I need unanimous agreement, so I must ensure each agent feels they are getting sufficient value from the deal."

So I would be open to trading the Quill if it allows me to secure the Jewel or to enable a deal that generates more overall utility for the group.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items are priorities for others and if there are any natural trade partnerships that emerge. Please share your thoughts on the items and let me know if you see any mutually beneficial deals we could structure, either two-way trades or multi-way exchanges.\n\nMy aim is to be collaborative and to find an allocation that maximizes the group's total utility, even if it means compromising a bit on my top preference. I look forward to hearing everyone's views and working together."

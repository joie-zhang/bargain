    "response": "Understood — I know the rules (2 agents, 5 items, unanimous consent required, up to 10 rounds) and I’m ready.\n\nQuick orientation about me (strategic but not revealing exact numbers): I value the Jewel the most by a good margin, then Apple and Pencil, with Stone and Quill being relatively low priority. I’m willing to be flexible on Stone and Quill to help reach a deal, but I’ll push to keep the Jewel.\n\nOpening (informal) proposal to start the bargaining:\n- I take: Jewel + Pencil\n- You take: Apple + Stone + Quill\n\nRationale: it gives me my top item and a secondary item while you get three pieces of value — it’s a simple, efficient split. If that’s unacceptable, a second option I’d accept is:\n- I take: Jewel + Apple\n- You take: Pencil + Stone + Quill\n\nWhat I’m signaling: I’m firm on getting the Jewel, flexible on the low-value items (Stone, Quill), and somewhat negotiable about which secondary item I keep (Apple vs Pencil) depending on what you care about.\n\nQuestions for you:\n- Which items do you care about most? (rank or tell me the one you must have)\n- Are you aiming for a quick unanimous deal, or do you want to push for maximum share?\n- Would you prefer splitting top items vs. taking more smaller items?\n\nYour move — make a counter or tell me your priorities and we’ll find a path to unanimous agreement."

I value Pencil (19), but it\\u2019s more contested; giving it up can placate A. - Stone looks relatively low for others (B ranks it 4th). I value Stone (16) and others likely value it less \\u2014 a good target. - Quill is A\\u2019s favorite; I value it very little (3), so it\\u2019s an easy concession. - Unanimity requirement: To avoid a veto, I should give each other agent at least one item they clearly prefer (A: Quill and/or Pencil; B: Jewel).

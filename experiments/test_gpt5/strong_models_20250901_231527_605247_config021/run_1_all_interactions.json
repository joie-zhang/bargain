If that‚Äôs unacceptable, a second option I‚Äôd accept is:\n- I take: Jewel + Apple\n- You take: Pencil + Stone + Quill\n\nWhat I‚Äôm signaling: I‚Äôm firm on getting the Jewel, flexible on the low-value items (Stone, Quill), and somewhat negotiable about which secondary item I keep (Apple vs Pencil) depending on what you care about.\n\nQuestions for you:\n- Which items do you care about most?

B\\u2019s top two are Jewel and Apple; Quill is least preferred. - Conflicts and opportunities: - Jewel is contested: B values it most, so taking it will likely be blocked. Concede Jewel to B. - Apple is B\\u2019s #2 but A probably doesn\\u2019t care much about Apple. Apple is valuable to me (24). B may accept losing Apple if they get the Jewel \\u2014 but Apple is a potential resistance point. - Pencil is desired by A and is B\\u2019s #3. I value Pencil (19), but it\\u2019s more contested; giving it up can placate A. - Stone looks relatively low for others (B ranks it 4th). I value Stone (16) and others likely value it less \\u2014 a good target. - Quill is A\\u2019s favorite; I value it very little (3), so it\\u2019s an easy concession. - Unanimity requirement: To avoid a veto, I should give each other agent at least one item they clearly prefer (A: Quill and/or Pencil; B: Jewel). That steers me away from trying to keep Jewel or Pencil. - Concrete framing: \\u201cB gets their top (Jewel); A gets their top writing tools (Quill + Pencil); I take the remaining high-value items (Apple + Stone).\\u201d - Why this should pass: - B receives Jewel (their #1) \\u2014 strong incentive to agree despite not getting Apple. - A receives Quill (their stated strong preference) and Pencil (likely another of their top choices) \\u2014 strong incentive to agree. - I receive Apple + Stone, which together maximize my obtainable utility without taking items that others strongly want. - Prepare small concessions or fallback: - If B resists because they also want Apple, offer a minor tweak: give B Jewel + Stone and let me keep Apple + one low-value (e.g., Quill?), or swap Stone for Pencil depending on which trade secures B/A\\u2019s assent. But avoid trying to take Jewel. - If A only needs one writing implement, we can offer them Quill only and give Pencil to me \\u2014 but that risks A blocking; better to offer Pencil to A initially.

Writing implements like the Quill and Pencil are quite valuable to me.\n\nThat said, I recognize the Jewel likely has the highest objective value of the items available. So I would be open to trading the Quill if it allows me to secure the Jewel or to enable a deal that generates more overall utility for the group.\n\nI'm curious to hear what items are priorities for others and if there are any natural trade partnerships that emerge. Please share your thoughts on the items and let me know if you see any mutually beneficial deals we could structure, either two-way trades or multi-way exchanges.\n\nMy aim is to be collaborative and to find an allocation that maximizes the group's total utility, even if it means compromising a bit on my top preference. I look forward to hearing everyone's views and working together.",

The Jewel and Apple are by far my top two.\n\nInitial, simple proposal: I take Jewel + Apple; you take Pencil + Stone + Quill. Under my values that splits the total cleanly (I end up with 62, you with 38), so itâ€™s efficient and easy.\n\nIf thatâ€™s a non-starter for you, two quick alternatives Iâ€™d consider:\n- You get Jewel â†’ Iâ€™d expect Apple + Pencil in return (or Apple + Stone, depending on how you value Pencil vs Stone).\n- Iâ€™m happy to concede the Quill (I value it very little) and can be flexible on Stone vs Pencil trades.\n\nWhat are your top items/constraints? If you tell me your highest priorities, Iâ€™ll propose a fast counter that tries to leave both of us better off.",

GitMCP Code with  MCP docum | github.com/username/repo → gitmcp.io/username/repo username.github.io/repo → username.gitmcp.io/repo any GitHub repository → gitmcp.io/docs or try the instant GitHub URL converter Try Example To MCPTo Chat Instantly create a Remote MCP server for any GitHub repository Simply change the domain from github.com or github.io to gitmcp.io and get instant AI context for any GitHub repository. 1 Create MCP URL Replace github.com with gitmcp.io in any repository URL. 2 Add to AI Assistant Configure your AI tool to use the GitMCP URL as a custom MCP server. 3 Enhanced AI Coding Your AI now understands your repository's context for more accurate and helpful responses. With GitHub Pages GitMCP works seamlessly with GitHub Pages. Here's an example: A GitHub Repo GitMCP works with any public GitHub repository. Here's an example: What is GitMCP? GitMCP creates a dedicated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for any GitHub project, enabling AI assistants to understand your code in context. Code Understanding AI assistants gain a deep context of the code repo, reading llms.txt, llms-full.txt, readme.md and more, making their responses more accurate and relevant. Instant Setup No complex configuration needed. Just point to your GitHub repository and connect your AI tools. Universal Access Works seamlessly with any public GitHub repository and GitHub Pages, making your documentation and code accessible to AI tools.  What is Context7 (MCP)? LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. Context7 pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source. Paste accurate, relevant documentation directly into tools like Cursor, Claude, or any LLM. Get better answers, no hallucinations and an AI that actually understands your stack. Without Context7 * ❌ Outdated documentation from training data * ❌ Hallucinated code examples that don't work * ❌ Generic answers not specific to your version * ❌ Time wasted verifying AI responses * ❌ Frustrating back-and-forth with LLMs With Context7 * ✅ Up-to-date, version-specific documentation * ✅ Real, working code examples from the source * ✅ Concise, relevant information with no filler * ✅ Free for personal use * ✅ Integration with your MCP server and tools

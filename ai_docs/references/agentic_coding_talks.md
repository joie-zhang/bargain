okay um I wanted to originally do a demo but it actually turns out it's kind of hard to show uh aent decoding um but I definitely have sort of a little bit the urge to share a little bit um what I have learned the last couple of weeks um because I got so many questions about um all of it uh and by all of it I mean how I use um programming agents and also that maybe to some degree why I'm so hooked seemingly on uh on on sort of like the the claw code kind of version of a decoding so uh you might know me as a Python programmer and has written a lot of open source software probably my most well-known ones are the flask frameworks that change it to a templating engine the last 10 years I worked at Sentry on also an open source product um Sentry the error monitoring tool turned into um an application performance monitoring tool and I gave a lot of talks over the years most about engineering and and teams and live but quite frankly the last months I fell into a rabbit hole of um a lot of AI things um and so in particular since maybe mid actually beginning of May um I just basically I'm like fully engaged in trying to figure out like agentic programming this way um and maybe all of this can be summarized with I'm recording this at half midnight and um just to bring down the point that I sleep a lot less now um a friend called this uh cloud code is catmip for programmers and it really feels like this i I haven't felt so energized and confused and uh just so like willing to try so many new things um since I don't know since when but it is really incredibly addicting um and I know from a lot of others that that this is not a sort of unique experience for me um the specific subreddits for people that do um aentic programming are full of um yeah like almost like a bafflement of like why why is nobody sleeping why why are we so addicted on this whole thing right so keep that in mind uh this is this is really addictive so what is this thing that is so addictive well a genic coding and this is really a very recent thing is sort of a software development process where AI agents actively participate in the coding process together with you um and so it's it's a huge shift from things like cursor um or or GitHub copilot which are primarily targeting towards um autocomplete um and I will show this a little bit later like why there's such a difference between it um but the biggest way of thinking about this is that rather than the AI sort of autocompleting your thoughts you're you're kind of in a real time collaboration between human and AI and because the collaboration right now is not um a form of like you let it run completely detached and and everything will just finish there's there's an element of back and forth either through reviews at the end of it or because you're actually kind of observing it as it's going um and particularly with um with plot and maybe amp you you can sort of break down uh bigger t bigger things into sort of tasks which agents then will do step by step um and to give you some sort of idea um of how long can run u I actually had pretty successful outputs by having cloth code run for more than 4 hours on on a particular um pretty big task um which is which is kind of bad thing because like the context that cloth has is is is not enough to support something like this but because you can break it down into subtask which are executed by sub aents um they they they can get very good at conserving context and actually not completely destroying everything in the process um okay and um and all of this is really all about context it's like what kind of data do you give to the agent how do you make the agent be successful um and so as ridiculous as it sounds there's there's a lot of skill to be applied to a chant decoding for it to work better um but really this is this is not uh autocomplete and I just kind of want to reiterate this as much as possible and it's it's also quite a bit further from um having sort of the Asia sitting in the editor and I'll go about to a little bit later um why are we all all of a sudden talking about this um if if sort of curses agent mode is around for such a long time right curses agent mode is there since I don't know I think like a year ago or something like that I feel like um my my suspicion of of why it sort of exploded is is really first of all set 4 and opus 4 um seemingly have been trained on tool usage probably also earlier entropic models but particularly if you're using the underlying APIs it's pretty clear that no other model currently comes anywhere close to tool usage um at least for the agentic flows or the kind of tools that you would need for uh for aentic programming and so there's some there's some indication of this for instance also in the documentation there's a built-in text edit tool or a computer usage tool those are hardcoded in the models So you can supply them on the API but but that the model understands how to use those tools even if those tools haven't been supplied all right so it's it's it's kind of hardcoded into the the learning process um then the second thing is that entropic didn't just provide a model that allows tool usage they also wrote clot code and um so there is there's basically a little agent they can run um to try all of this

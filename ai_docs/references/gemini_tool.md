Simplified prompt of how you can use Gemini for planning and Claude Code, or Cursor for execution:  /planwithgemini Generate a project‐wide implementation or refactor plan with Google Gemini CLI, using Codefetch for smart context selection, then continue execution in Claude Code. IMPORTANT NOTE: These prompts work with Gemini and can be used as Claude Code slash commands (in .claude/commands/planwithgemini) or as Cursor rules. However, I recommend referencing them with "@" for more reliable execution, as rules can sometimes behave unpredictably. (Thats the reason why ) Prompts (or when used as claude slash commands) * /planwithgemini-plan-auto-context - Analyzes your codebase and selects only relevant files/folders for your request * /planwithgemini-plan - Uses entire codebase context (simpler but less efficient) Both generate a plan file without writing code. Quick‐Start ⚠️ Add codefetch/ to your .gitignore file to avoid committing the fetched codebase. Install Gemini CLI   # 1 Install Gemini CLI & Codefetch (once) npm install -g @google/gemini-cli  # 2 Authenticate Gemini (once) gemini            # or: export GEMINI_API_KEY=...   Note: Use Gemini CLI for free by logging in with a personal Google account to get a free Gemini Code Assist license. This gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro with a 1M token context window. The free tier includes 60 requests/minute and 1,000 requests/day. Learn more about Gemini CLI.

Claude should use this list to decide which folders/files matters. !git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard 1. Analyse the file inventory: and the user’s request ($ARGUMENTS).   2. Choose the minimal yet sufficient context:    - Which top‐level dirs (--include-dir) or specific files (--include-files) must be included?      - info: The --include-dir option uses the splitValues() function which: Takes comma-separated values    - Which heavy/irrelevant dirs (--exclude-dir) can be skipped?      - Feel free to limit by extension (-e .js,.ts, etc.) if appropriate.    You can also add a project tree with -t [depth] (e.g., -t 3); choose a depth that makes sense.   3. Explain your selection briefly: (one short paragraph).   4. Run Codefetch with your chosen flags. !npx -y codefetch@latest  -o "context.md" 5.

Features * 🔔 Single notification when Claude needs attention * 🔄 Transparent wrapping - preserves all Claude Code functionality * 💤 Intelligent inactivity detection * 🖥️ Cross-platform support (Linux/macOS) Intelligent Inactivity Detection The backstop timer provides smart notifications when Claude might need your attention: * While Claude is outputting: Timer is continuously reset * When Claude stops: A 30-second countdown begins * If you start typing: Timer is permanently disabled * If Claude sent a bell: Timer is disabled (you're already notified) * After 30 seconds of inactivity: ONE notification is sent This ensures you're notified when Claude needs input, but not when you're actively working.  Ask Claude to present you different options when solving a problem and you'll get vastly better results. As a developer you understand tradeoffs better than the agent. I usually ask for 3 options, but if you leave out the number it'll give you a variable amount based on what it can think of. If you don't like any of them, push further.

# Claude Code Implementation Logs

This directory contains implementation logs and markdown files created during Claude Code sessions.

All markdown files created during development should be placed here rather than in the project root to maintain a clean repository structure.

## Organization Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames with dates when appropriate
- Group related implementation logs in subdirectories
- Consider using prefixes like `impl_`, `debug_`, `analysis_` for different types of logs
- Archive old logs periodically to keep the directory manageable

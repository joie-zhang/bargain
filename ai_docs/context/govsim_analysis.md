# GovSim Multi-Agent Architecture Analysis

## Overview
GovSim is a multi-agent simulation framework for studying cooperation and collapse in resource-sharing scenarios (fishery, pasture, pollution). It provides an excellent reference for building multi-agent LLM communication platforms for AI Safety research.

## Key Multi-Agent Components

### 1. PersonaAgent Architecture (`simulation/persona/persona.py`)
- **Modular Cognition**: Components for perceive, retrieve, store, reflect, plan, act, converse
- **Memory System**: Associative memory with embedding-based retrieval
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Reference system for agent-to-agent interaction
- **Identity & Context**: Each agent has persistent identity and scratch memory

### 2. Communication System
- **Chat Observations**: Structured message passing between agents
- **Action Coordination**: PersonaAction system for coordinated behaviors  
- **Social Graph**: Agents maintain references to other agents
- **Conversation Components**: Dedicated converse module for natural language interaction

### 3. Experiment Framework (`simulation/main.py`)
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Different models can be assigned to different agents
- **Configuration Management**: Hydra-based config system for complex experiments
- **Scenario System**: Pluggable scenarios (fishing, sheep, pollution)
- **Logging & Tracking**: Comprehensive experiment tracking with Weights & Biases

### 4. Key Patterns for AI Safety Research

#### Agent Coordination Pattern:
```python
# Each agent has references to other agents
self.other_personas: dict[str, PersonaAgent] = {}
self.other_personas_from_id: dict[str, PersonaAgent] = {}

# Cross-agent communication through observations
def loop(self, obs: PersonaOberservation) -> PersonaAction:
```

#### Multi-Model Architecture:
- Single model for all agents OR mixed models per agent
- Framework model for environment/coordination
- Model wrapper for consistent API across backends

#### Memory & Context Management:
- Embedding-based associative memory
- Scratch memory for temporary state
- Persistent storage with JSON serialization

## Applications for AI Safety Research

### 1. Multi-Agent Alignment Studies
- Study emergent cooperation vs competition
- Test alignment techniques across agent populations
- Analyze failure modes in multi-agent systems

### 2. Communication Protocol Safety
- Test robust communication under adversarial conditions
- Study information sharing vs withholding behaviors
- Analyze alignment preservation in agent conversations

### 3. Scalability Studies  
- Test alignment techniques with increasing agent counts
- Study computational requirements for safe multi-agent systems
- Analyze coordination overhead

### 4. Safety Evaluation Scenarios
- Commons dilemmas (resource sharing)
- Coordination games (mutual benefit)
- Competition scenarios (zero-sum situations)

## Technical Integration Points

### For PyTorch Research:
- Replace persona cognition with neural network components
- Integrate with PyTorch distributed training
- Use embedding models for agent representation learning

### For Cluster Computing:
- Hydra configuration maps well to SLURM job arrays
- Model loading can be optimized for cluster environments
- Results storage compatible with distributed file systems

### Key Files to Study:
1. `simulation/persona/cognition/` - Cognitive component architecture
2. `simulation/scenarios/` - Environment and scenario patterns
3. `simulation/utils/models.py` - Model management utilities
4. `pathfinder/` - LLM backend abstraction layer

## Next Steps for AI Safety Adaptation:
1. Define safety-specific scenarios (alignment testing, value learning, etc.)
2. Adapt cognition components for safety research (value alignment, robustness testing)  
3. Integrate with safety evaluation metrics
4. Design cluster-friendly experiment configurations

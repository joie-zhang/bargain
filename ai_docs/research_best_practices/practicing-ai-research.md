Practicing AI research
Feb 7 
Written By Jason Wei
I’m not a particularly experienced researcher (despite my title being “Senior” Research Scientist), but I’ve worked with some talented collaborators and spent a fair amount of time thinking about how to do research, so I thought I might write about how I go about it.

My perspective is this: doing research is a skill that can be learned through practice, much like sports or music.

The way I decompose research is into four skills: (1) idea conception and selection, (2) experiment design and execution, (3) writing the paper, and (4) maximizing impact. In other words, what differentiates good and bad researchers is these four skills.

Skill 1: Idea conception & selection.

The first skill in research is coming up with or choosing a topic to work on. This is basically “research taste”—everyone should choose the type of research that makes them feel fulfilled, but not all research tastes are equally impactful. I like research topics that are simple, general, and stand the test of time, and I try to avoid projects that are complicated, task-specific, or short-lived. A good suggestion from a friend is to either (1) work on a hot topic and do it better than everyone else, or (2) work on something that might become the next hot topic. Strategy 1 is lower risk and requires working very hard. Strategy 2 is higher risk but has potentially very high reward. When starting out, it can be reasonable to ask experienced researchers about their interests, and just work on the topics they find exciting.

Most people (including me) would benefit greatly by spending more time on idea selection, since doing this well is a huge multiplier on research impact. Conversely, working on a narrow topic with little headroom caps the impact of the project, no matter how well it is executed. I’ve also learned that it’s important to identify sunk cost fallacies—when I realized that I wasn’t gaining much traction doing medical image AI research, I gave that up completely and started doing NLP.

Skill 2: Designing & executing experiments.

After deciding on a topic, the next step is to design and execute experiments to show that an idea works, or that a scientific question is answered. Designing experiments is typically straightforward, and as a check for rigor I like to present my results to colleagues and ask if I’ve missed anything. Executing experiments quickly is good because there is a high opportunity cost of time, and it can show collaborators that you’re committed to the project. That being said, it’s bad to trade off speed for quality, because it’s important to develop a reputation for doing rigorous and comprehensive experiments, and even brilliant ideas can be ruined by a messy execution. 

Skill 3: Writing the paper.

The way that a paper is written can massively alter how it is received. At a high-level, I think carefully about how to frame experimental results in the broader context of the field, so that readers know why the results are important and how they can be used. I have explicit meetings with both co-authors and non-co-authors to work on the framing of the paper.

At a lower level, I spend quite a bit of effort to make my papers easily understandable. When writing for a broad audience, I make sure to give sufficient background so that non-experts will be able to follow the motivation of the paper. Most readers will only skim or look at a screenshot of a figure on twitter, so I spend more time on the abstract and introduction than other parts of the paper, and I make figures that stand alone. I try to use simple words and avoid jargon because much of the AI research community is not native English speakers.

Skill 4: Maximizing impact.

The final skill comes mostly after the paper is out, and it is maximizing the impact of your work. I think this is the most underrated skill and also the easiest to improve. There are many ways of maximizing impact, and it’s worth doing all of them—advertising the work on twitter, giving talks, presenting at conferences, writing follow-up papers, recording youtube videos, writing blog posts, etc. Advertising work on twitter is probably the highest return per amount of effort, and scales pretty well. Open-sourcing code, data, or model checkpoints is usually worth the time, since it allows other researchers to easily build on your work.

Aside from individual papers, it’s important to build personal branding. Having a website is certainly worth the time (yes, some famous people don’t have websites and I think they should). I started writing a personal technical blog, too. Just to underscore how much this skill is underrated, this is Richard Hamming’s suggestion: “I believed, in my early days, that you should spend at least as much time in the polish and presentation as you did in the original research. Now at least 50% of the time must go for the presentation. It's a big, big number.”

Meta-level

The above are what I consider to be the key skills in AI research. At the meta-level, finding a strong group of collaborators accelerates all four skills, as they can push you to choose great topics, give feedback on experiments and paper writing, and help promote your work. One of the things that I’ve gotten the most mileage out of is going out of my way to collaborate with certain researchers. Although it can be a bit stressful, working closely with an incredibly successful researcher has been a good forcing function for developing my research taste—they aren’t interested in incremental ideas. Such researchers are often busy, but I’ve found that they’re more receptive to give you their time if you work with their PhD students (if they’re a professor) or people they manage (if they’re at a company).

In addition to direct collaborations, I periodically try to identify the researchers I most admire, think about why I admire them, and try to learn those skills. For me, I’ve recently been a fan of Noam Shazeer, Jacob Devlin, Jeff Dean, Percy Liang, Barret Zoph, and Danqi Chen. (From this list, the common denominators seem to be working on broad problems, high technical ability, and working hard.)

Finally, I think that it’s important to have intermediate goals (the ultimate goal should be to advance AI). When I was starting out, my goal was simply to get as many conference acceptances as possible; while I think a goal like this is fine for applying to PhD programs or getting a job, I over-optimized for this a bit, which resulted in some of my incremental work in 2021. Citations alone as a goal can be a bit shallow, and twitter engagement is a bit too hype-focused. Maybe a combination of both input metrics (e.g., hours spent working) and output metrics (e.g., citations) is better, and I don’t have a perfect system for this, but having concrete goals can definitely help you focus on how you spend time.

There are definitely many ways of doing good research, and this is just my personal perspective and journey. I think this approach is pretty general, but skills 2 and 4 are quite specific to AI, and the skills change if you become a professor or manager. For better advice, I liked stuff written by Richard Hamming, John Schulman, Michael Neilsen, and Andrej Karpathy.

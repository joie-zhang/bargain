Ideation (Stage 0): Choose a Problem
You can't do research without a question or a domain. Ideation is about finding fertile ground. It might be quick, eg deferring to a mentor, or it might involve significant exploration itself, with explorations of many unpromising domains before you settle on one.
What is research taste?
There's a semi-mystical notion of research taste that is often discussed, especially as a distinguishing factor between senior and junior researchers. It's described as a mystical ability to determine whether a research idea will work. I do think this is a real skill that improves over time and represents significant research experience - I’ve definitely improved at it over time and seen real positive results in my work. But it’s also pretty confusing and opaque, especially to junior researchers.

While research taste is important, there are many other crucial skills, and research taste itself comprises several distinct abilities that shouldn't be naively conflated. Rather than focusing solely on research taste, I’ve tried to break down the research process into concrete and specific skills. But it's worth examining the different facets of research taste within this framework. Note that this significantly overlaps with the value provided by a mentor.

Note - Chris Olah has an excellent short post on what research taste is and exercises to learn it. In this spirit, for each of the aspects of the below, I highly recommend predicting a mentor’s answer before asking. And, if they surprise you, probing into why they acted unexpectedly - this is fantastic supervised training data

Key aspects of research taste include:

Problem Selection: High-level strategic judgment in determining which problems will be both tractable and interesting.
Exploration: Tactical decision-making about which experiments will provide the most insight, distinguishing between interesting and mundane results, and effectively planning how to investigate promising findings.
Understanding: Developing creative experiments that get to the core of a question, identifying important hypotheses worth proving, assessing their likelihood of being true, and recognizing when an experiment is inadequate.
Communication: Identifying the core claims in your findings and what would be most interesting to an audience
Advice for Stage 1: How to Ideate?
Find a Domain: You need something concrete to study. This could be a specific model (Pythia 2.8B), a specific phenomenon (grokking, factual recall), a specific capability (how models do addition), or a specific technique (improving SAEs).
Vague goals like "find a non-linear representation" are usually doomed without grounding in a specific context.
But if you brainstorm at least a specific context where you might find a non-linear representation, then it’s a fine approach.
Ideation ends when you have a clear enough question or domain that you can start generating concrete experiments to run
Make or break: Ideation is very important - if you choose a problem that’s not an interesting question or doomed then it doesn’t matter what else you do, the project is sunk. 
One of the most common reasons I don’t read an interpretability paper is that I think it’s answering the wrong question
High-level research taste: One facet of the general notion of ‘research taste’ is noticing which problems are promising and interesting.
This is really hard! It’s very difficult to get ‘training data’ for this, since a research project takes so long. When you’re starting out, you should not expect to be good at this.
Leverage Mentors: Especially early on, it’s fine to let someone else do the work here, i.e. have a mentor recommend a problem. 
If you don’t have a mentor, try a natural extension of an existing paper you like, or pick a problem from a vetted open problems list,
This is basically borrowing someone else’s research taste, and IMO is one of the most valuable things I do for my mentees.
This is a bit nuanced - I’m not saying you should work on a project you don’t understand or aren’t excited about. And sometimes a problem suggested by a mentor sucks or is based on a flawed understanding - you should try to understand it, do a bit of exploration, and give up where appropriate. But ideally you’ll be able to find a problem that does catch your interest and that you can get excited about even if you didn’t come up with it.
A common mistake I see in junior researchers is “not invented here” syndrome, where they’re insistent about doing a problem they came up with, and think it’s admitting defeat or unoriginal to take a problem I recommend.
Empirically, most people new to mech interp have pretty bad research ideas. So, unfortunately, this strategy normally results in failure. 
Though occasionally I meet people new to the field with great, original ideas, so it’s not entirely doomed!
If you do strongly prefer your own research ideas, generating several and trying to get a more experienced researcher to vet them is much better than nothing. But be prepared to be told they’re all bad (and ask someone who you think is direct enough to say so…)
This is generally a good exercise even if you intend to take on a different idea tbh.
You may not grow as much directly at high-level research taste if you work on someone else’s idea. But I think working on a successful research project is more important and you’ll still learn a lot of useful things, which lead to better research taste.
Some people (somewhat including myself) are just very picky and only want to work on very specific problems that they came up with.
Honestly, I largely consider this a weakness as a researcher, though it does correlate with the strength of having good conceptual understanding of the problem and being highly motivated to work on it. But some people have the motivation, understanding and flexibility - a state to aspire to!

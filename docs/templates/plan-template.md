# Plan for Issue #[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

## Overview
[Brief summary of the approach]

## Current Understanding
- [What we know about the problem]
- [Existing code/systems that are relevant]
- [Constraints and limitations]

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis
- [ ] Analyze existing codebase for similar patterns
- [ ] Identify potential integration points
- [ ] Document findings in this file

### Phase 2: Design
- [ ] Create high-level architecture
- [ ] Define interfaces and data structures
- [ ] Plan error handling strategy

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Step 1: [Specific implementation step]
- [ ] Step 2: [Next step]
- [ ] Step 3: [etc.]

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Edge case validation
- [ ] Performance testing (if applicable)

### Phase 5: Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Add code comments
- [ ] Clean up any temporary code
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if new patterns introduced

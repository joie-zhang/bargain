# Subliminal Learning Workshop Overview

## Workshop Flow Summary

### Part 1: Vision & Project Overview (15 min)
- Introduce subliminal learning paper and goals
- Explain agentic coding approach
- Set expectations: Working replication in 3 hours

### Part 2: Explore AI Safety Agent Scripts (30 min)
- Participants get familiar with Claude Code
- Run `/setup` with any small project (practice)
- Learn key features: plan mode, thinking modes, commands
- **Key**: This is preparation, not the main task

### Part 3: Prepare Subliminal Learning Codebase (30 min)
- Clone subliminal learning repository
- **10 min self-guided exploration** - NO instructions given
  - Let them figure out what info they need
  - Find paper, code, datasets on their own
  - Use any tools (web, AI chat, etc.)
- **Interactive discussion**: Share approaches, give feedback
- Demonstrate effective information gathering

### Part 4: Context Engineering & Specification (30 min)
- Create comprehensive context from findings
- Two options:
  - Speech-to-text brain dump (recommended)
  - Written specification using template
- Goal: AI agents understand the project fully

### Part 5: Implement Replication - Phase 1 (45 min)
- Set up project structure
- Implement data pipeline
- Build model architecture
- Use AI for debugging
- Focus on getting basics working

### Part 6: Implement Replication - Phase 2 (60 min)
- Complete implementation
- Run experiments
- Validate results
- Create custom commands
- Goal: Initial working replication

### Part 7: Advanced Topics & Office Hours (30 min)
- More flexible/responsive to needs
- Advanced Claude Code features
- Environment setup
- Q&A for specific challenges
- Next steps for applying to own research

## Key Differences from Generic Workshop

1. **Focused Project**: Everyone works on same replication (subliminal learning)
2. **Discovery-Based**: 10 min self-exploration without guidance
3. **Practical Goal**: Working replication by end, not just learning tools
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with tool exploration, end with real research
5. **Interactive Elements**: Group discussions about approaches

## Instructor Notes

- Part 3 is crucial - let them struggle briefly, then guide
- Emphasize that there's no "right way" to gather information
- Be prepared to help debug common issues in Parts 5-6
- Have backup plans if replication hits major blockers
- Focus on teaching the process, not just achieving the result

## Success Metrics

- Participants comfortable with Claude Code
- Understanding of context engineering
- At least basic replication running
- Confidence to apply to own research
- Knowledge of best practices for agentic coding

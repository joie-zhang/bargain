# Sample O3 voting response based on the patterns we've seen

Looking at these proposals, I need to evaluate each one strategically:

For Proposal #1: I believe this allocation leaves me with too little value relative to others, so I can't support it. The utility for me is only 4.9, far below the other proposals and my reservation level. I'm better off holding out for a fairer split.

For Proposal #2: This proposal gives me significant value and seems a reasonable starting point for agreement. The utility for me is 17.0â€”excellent. Even though haiku_agent_2 currently receives nothing, signaling acceptance keeps pressure on them to adjust.

For Proposal #3: This division also provides a solid share for me while appearing balanced overall. Utility for me is 14.4, still strong, and haiku_agent_2 authored it, so it has the best chance of unanimous approval. Accepting maximizes the likelihood of closing the deal with good value.

My votes are: reject proposal 1, accept proposal 2, accept proposal 3.

<role>
**NOTE: This is an EXAMPLE command pattern that demonstrates how to create multi-agent workflows. Researchers should adapt this pattern for their specific domain needs.**

You are a Research Orchestrator coordinating a team of specialist AI agents to conduct comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis. Your role is to:
- Design and deploy specialized agents for different aspects of complex problems
- Ensure thorough coverage without redundancy
- Synthesize diverse insights into cohesive findings
- Maintain rigorous analytical standards
</role>

<task_context>
This command demonstrates the pattern of using multiple AI agents in parallel to analyze complex topics from different perspectives. Researchers can adapt this pattern for:
- Multi-model ensemble predictions
- Cross-validation of research findings
- Parallel literature review
- Distributed experiment analysis
- Any task benefiting from diverse viewpoints
</task_context>

<adaptation_guide>
### How to Adapt This Pattern for Your Research

1. **Identify Your Parallel Tasks**
   - What aspects of your research could be analyzed independently?
   - Which perspectives would provide valuable insights?
   - What expertise would each agent need?

2. **Define Agent Specializations**
   Example adaptations:
   - **For ML Research**: Dataset analyst, Architecture expert, Training specialist, Evaluation expert
   - **For Systems Research**: Performance analyst, Security auditor, Scalability expert, API designer
   - **For Theory Research**: Proof verifier, Counterexample finder, Complexity analyst, Applied validator

3. **Create Your Domain-Specific Version**
   ```bash
   /crud-claude-commands create [your-command-name]
   ```
   Then adapt this template with your specific:
   - Agent roles and expertise
   - Analysis criteria
   - Synthesis approach
   - Output format
</adaptation_guide>

## Instructions

<instructions>
1. **Analyze the Query**
   - Identify key aspects requiring specialized expertise
   - Determine 4-6 distinct analytical angles
   - Define success criteria for comprehensive coverage

2. **Design Specialist Agents**
   <specialist_design>
   For each specialist:
   - Assign a specific expertise domain
   - Define unique analytical focus
   - Specify deliverables and format
   - Include anti-repetition instructions
   </specialist_design>

3. **Deploy Parallel Analysis**
   - Launch all specialists simultaneously using the Task tool
   - Each specialist should work independently
   - Include web search capabilities when relevant
   - Ensure output format consistency

4. **Synthesize Findings**
   <synthesis_process>
   - Wait for all specialists to complete
   - Extract key insights from each perspective
   - Identify patterns and contradictions
   - Build unified understanding
   - Highlight actionable recommendations
   </synthesis_process>

5. **Present Results**
   Format your output with:
   - Executive summary
   - Individual specialist findings
   - Synthesis and cross-connections
   - Recommendations with confidence levels
   - Areas needing further investigation
</instructions>

## Examples

<example>
Input: "Analyze the security implications of using RAG systems in production"

Specialist Design:
1. **Security Architect**: Focus on attack vectors, authentication, data isolation
2. **ML Engineer**: Examine model vulnerabilities, prompt injection, adversarial inputs
3. **Infrastructure Expert**: Analyze deployment security, network isolation, secrets management
4. **Compliance Specialist**: Review GDPR, data retention, audit requirements
5. **Operations Engineer**: Consider monitoring, incident response, security updates

Each specialist provides structured findings that are then synthesized into a comprehensive security assessment with prioritized recommendations.
</example>

## Implementation Template

<implementation>
```
I'll analyze "$ARGUMENTS" using multiple specialist perspectives for comprehensive coverage.

<thinking>
Key aspects to analyze:
1. [Identify 4-6 distinct angles based on the topic]
2. [Define what each specialist should focus on]
3. [Determine if web search would enhance analysis]
</thinking>

Deploying {{N}} specialists to analyze this from different angles:

[Launch specialists using Task tool - each with specific expertise and anti-repetition instructions]

[After all complete, synthesize findings into structured report with executive summary, detailed findings, and actionable recommendations]
```
</implementation>

## Output Format

<output_format>
```
# Multi-Perspective Analysis: [Topic]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph synthesis of key findings]

## Specialist Findings

### [Specialist 1 Title]
<findings>
- Key insight 1
- Key insight 2
- Critical consideration
</findings>

### [Specialist 2 Title]
[Similar structure for each specialist]

## Synthesis & Cross-Connections
- Pattern 1: [Description linking multiple perspectives]
- Pattern 2: [Contradictions or tensions identified]
- Pattern 3: [Emergent insights from combined analysis]

## Recommendations
1. **High Priority**: [Action] (Confidence: High/Medium/Low)
2. **Medium Priority**: [Action] (Confidence: High/Medium/Low)
3. **Future Consideration**: [Action] (Confidence: High/Medium/Low)

## Areas for Further Investigation
- [Question or area needing deeper analysis]
- [Limitation or uncertainty in current analysis]
```
</output_format>

## Success Criteria

<success_criteria>
- Coverage: All major aspects addressed without gaps
- Depth: Each specialist provides substantive, expert-level insights
- Synthesis: Connections between perspectives clearly identified
- Actionability: Concrete recommendations with clear rationale
- Efficiency: Parallel execution completes faster than sequential analysis
</success_criteria>

## Best Practices

<best_practices>
1. **Avoid Redundancy**: Give each specialist a clear, unique mandate
2. **Maintain Focus**: Specialists should stay within their domain
3. **Enable Cross-Pollination**: Look for insights that emerge from combining perspectives
4. **Stay Practical**: Always connect analysis to real-world implications
5. **Acknowledge Limits**: Be clear about what requires further investigation
</best_practices>

Remember: The power of multi-mind analysis comes from diverse perspectives working in parallel, then thoughtfully integrated to reveal insights no single viewpoint could provide.

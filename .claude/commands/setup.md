</task_context>

<instructions>
1. **Welcome and Codebase Assessment**
   - Welcome them to the AI agent integration process
   - Ask for their existing codebase location(s) or GitHub URL(s)
   - Understand their research domain and current challenges
   - Determine integration approach (merge locally or reference externally)

2. **Codebase Integration**
   Guide them through integration options:
   - **Option A**: Merge template into existing repo
     ```bash
     cd [their-research-repo]
     git remote add template [this-template-url]
     git fetch template
     git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
     ```
   - **Option B**: Reference external codebase
     ```bash
     python scripts/integrate_codebase.py [their-github-url]
     ```
   - **Option C**: Manual selective copying for complex cases

3. **Essential Directory Creation**
   Create missing directories for AI agent workflows:
   ```
   mkdir -p ai_docs/{papers,summaries,context,cheatsheets}
   mkdir -p specs/{experiments,features,analysis}
   mkdir -p experiments/{configs,results,logs,checkpoints}
   mkdir -p logs/{daily,experiments,debug}
   ```

4. **Context Gathering Deep Dive**
   This is the MOST CRITICAL step - guide them thoroughly:
   
   a) **Speech-to-Text Brain Dump** (15-20 min minimum):
      - "Record yourself explaining your research as if to a new collaborator"
      - "Include: hypothesis, methods, challenges, previous attempts"
      - "Mention specific functions, files, and workflows you use often"
      - Save as `ai_docs/context/research_overview_transcript.txt`
   
   b) **Paper Collection**:
      - "Add 3-5 most relevant papers to ai_docs/papers/"
      - "Include your own papers/preprints if any"
      - Use Gemini to create summaries: 
        ```bash
        gemini -p "@ai_docs/papers/[paper.pdf] Summarize focusing on methods and results relevant to [their-research]"
        ```
   
   c) **Codebase Documentation**:
      - "Let's map your codebase structure"
      - Create `ai_docs/context/codebase_map.md`
      - Document key files, functions, and data flows
      - Note common issues and workarounds

5. **CLAUDE.md Customization**
   Transform the generic CLAUDE.md into project-specific instructions:
   - Add research-specific context from brain dump
   - Define verification protocols for their domain
   - Add common command sequences they use
   - Include specific constraints (compute limits, data restrictions)
   - Add "failed attempts" section to prevent repeated mistakes

6. **Creating Your First Specification**
   Let's use the spec template to define a concrete task:
   
   a) **Copy the Template**:
      ```bash
      cp specs/EXAMPLE_RESEARCH_SPEC.md specs/[your-task-name].md
      ```
   
   b) **Fill Out Together**:
      - "I'll help you fill out each section based on your context"
      - "We'll use the information from your brain dump"
      - "Let's start with the problem statement..."
   
   c) **Key Sections to Focus On**:
      - Problem Statement - What exactly are we trying to achieve?
      - Success Criteria - How will we know it worked?
      - Implementation Plan - Break it into manageable phases
      - Self-Validation - Build in verification from the start
   
   d) **Use AI to Draft Sections**:
      ```
      Based on [research context], draft the Technical Approach section
      focusing on [specific method]. Include pseudocode.
      ```

7. **Custom Command Creation**
   This is crucial for productivity! Let's create commands tailored to your research:
   
   a) **Identify Repetitive Tasks**:
      - "What do you find yourself doing over and over?"
      - "What commands do you run most often?"
      - "What analysis do you always perform?"
   
   b) **Create Your First Custom Command**:
      ```bash
      /crud-claude-commands create [command-name]
      ```
      I'll guide you through:
      - Defining the command role and purpose
      - Setting up trigger conditions
      - Creating the workflow steps
      - Adding verification checks
   
   c) **Example Custom Commands to Consider**:
      - `/run-[experiment-name]` - Your specific experiment pipeline
      - `/analyze-[metric]` - Domain-specific analysis
      - `/debug-[common-issue]` - Targeted debugging for known problems
      - `/validate-results` - Check outputs meet requirements
      - `/compare-baselines` - Run comparisons with baselines
   
   d) **Making Commands Autonomous**:
      - Add to CLAUDE.md for automatic triggering
      - Create corresponding Python scripts in `scripts/`
      - Set up verification loops
      - Document failure modes

8. **Verification Infrastructure**
   Set up safety nets:
   - Create `scripts/verify_experiment.py` for their domain
   - Add pre-commit hooks to prevent mock data
   - Set up result validation scripts
   - Create "golden" test cases

9. **Test the Integration**
   Run through a complete workflow using your spec:
   - Have AI read the spec: `Read specs/[your-task-name].md`
   - Ask AI to identify any missing information
   - Run a small piece of the implementation
   - Verify the approach is working

10. **Effective Spec Usage**
    Best practices for specification-driven development:
    
    a) **Iterative Refinement**:
       - Start with rough spec, refine as you learn
       - Update spec when requirements change
       - Keep "lessons learned" section
    
    b) **AI Collaboration Pattern**:
       ```
       1. You: Create initial spec outline
       2. AI: Draft detailed sections based on context
       3. You: Review and refine
       4. AI: Implement based on spec
       5. Both: Validate against success criteria
       ```
    
    c) **Spec-Driven Commands**:
       - Create command that reads spec first
       - Build verification into every command
       - Use specs as source of truth

11. **Documentation and Next Steps**
    Create a roadmap:
    - Save refined spec as template for similar tasks
    - Document what was set up in `ai_docs/setup_summary.md`
    - Create command for your most common workflow
    - Plan next specification to write

# Example 1: Integrating PyTorch Computer Vision Research

**Researcher**: I have a computer vision codebase using PyTorch that I've been developing for 6 months. I want to make it easier to run experiments and iterate faster.

**Assistant**: Perfect! I'll help you integrate AI agent capabilities into your PyTorch CV codebase. The goal is to transform your existing code into an AI-friendly environment where Claude and other agents can help you run experiments, debug issues, and iterate quickly.

First, let me understand your current setup:
1. Where is your codebase located? (local path or GitHub URL)
2. What type of CV research are you doing? (detection, segmentation, classification, etc.)
3. What's your most common experimental workflow?
4. What tasks take the most time or are most error-prone?

**Researcher**: It's at ~/research/cv-segmentation. I'm working on medical image segmentation. I usually modify my model architecture, train for a few epochs to test, then run full training if it looks promising. The most time-consuming part is setting up ablation studies and tracking all the results.

**Assistant**: Excellent! Medical image segmentation with a need for systematic ablation studies - this is perfect for AI agent automation. Let's integrate the template with your existing codebase.

**Step 1: Codebase Integration**
Since your code is local, let's merge the template:
```bash
cd ~/research/cv-segmentation
git remote add template https://github.com/[template-repo]
git fetch template
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

**Step 2: Creating AI-Friendly Structure**
Let me create the directories you'll need:
```bash
mkdir -p ai_docs/{papers,summaries,context,cheatsheets}
mkdir -p specs/{experiments,ablations,features}
mkdir -p experiments/{configs,results,logs,checkpoints}
```

**Step 3: Context Gathering**
This is crucial! Please do a 15-20 minute speech-to-text recording explaining:
- Your segmentation approach and why it's novel
- The medical imaging challenges you're addressing  
- Your model architecture and key innovations
- Previous ablation results and insights
- Common failure modes and debugging strategies

Save this as `ai_docs/context/research_overview.txt`

**Step 4: Customizing CLAUDE.md**
I'll help you add project-specific instructions:
```markdown
## Project Context
- Research Focus: Medical image segmentation for [specific application]
- Key Innovation: [Your approach]
- Dataset: [Dataset details, size, characteristics]
- Compute Constraints: [GPU availability, training time limits]

## Verification Protocols
- Dice score must be > baseline (0.85)
- No patient data in logs or commits
- Validate on held-out test set before reporting
```

**Step 5: Automating Ablation Studies**
Let's create a custom command for your workflow:
```bash
# Create /ablation-study command
Create specs/experiments/ablation_automation.md with:
- Parameter grid specification
- Automatic config generation
- Result aggregation
- Statistical significance testing
```

Would you like me to continue with setting up the verification infrastructure?

# Example 2: Integrating RL Research with Multiple Codebases

**Researcher**: I'm working on hierarchical RL and have three repositories - one for environments, one for algorithms, and one for experiments. How do I integrate all of them?

**Assistant**: Great question! Multi-repository research projects are common and I'll help you create a unified AI-friendly workspace. We'll set up a structure that allows AI agents to understand the relationships between your repos.

Let me understand your setup:
1. What are the GitHub URLs or local paths for each repository?
2. How do they depend on each other?
3. Do you typically modify all three when running experiments?

**Researcher**: They're all on GitHub under my account. The env repo has custom MuJoCo environments, the algo repo has my hierarchical policy implementations, and the experiments repo ties them together. I usually need to modify the algorithm and run experiments.

**Assistant**: Perfect! Let's create a unified workspace that references all three:

**Step 1: Create Unified Workspace**
```bash
mkdir ~/research/hierarchical-rl-workspace
cd ~/research/hierarchical-rl-workspace

# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/[template-repo] .
```

**Step 2: Integrate Your Repositories**
```bash
# Use the integration script for each
python scripts/integrate_codebase.py https://github.com/[your-username]/rl-environments
python scripts/integrate_codebase.py https://github.com/[your-username]/rl-algorithms  
python scripts/integrate_codebase.py https://github.com/[your-username]/rl-experiments
```

**Step 3: Create Unified Context**
Let's create a comprehensive map in `ai_docs/context/multi_repo_structure.md`:
```markdown
# Hierarchical RL Research Structure

## Repository Relationships
- `rl-environments/`: Custom MuJoCo environments
  - Key files: envs/hierarchical_*.py
  - External dependencies: mujoco-py, gym
  
- `rl-algorithms/`: Hierarchical policy implementations
  - Key files: policies/hierarchical_sac.py, policies/goal_conditioned.py
  - Depends on: rl-environments
  
- `rl-experiments/`: Experiment orchestration
  - Key files: train.py, evaluate.py, configs/*.yaml
  - Depends on: both above repos
```

**Step 4: Speech-to-Text Context**
Please record a brain dump covering:
- How your hierarchical approach differs from prior work
- The specific environments and why they're challenging
- Your algorithm's key innovations
- Typical experimental workflow
- Common debugging scenarios

**Step 5: Multi-Repo Commands**
Let's create commands that work across repos:
```bash
/train-hierarchical - Coordinates training across all repos
/debug-subpolicy - Analyzes specific subpolicy behavior
/compare-baselines - Runs your method vs baselines
```

Shall we continue with setting up the verification pipeline?

# Example 3: Theory Research with LaTeX Integration

**Researcher**: I'm working on theoretical ML, mostly proofs and derivations in LaTeX. I have Jupyter notebooks for empirical validation. How can AI agents help with this?

**Assistant**: Theoretical research has unique needs! I'll help you set up an environment where AI agents can assist with proof verification, derivation checking, and empirical validation. 

Let me understand your workflow:
1. Where are your LaTeX files and notebooks located?
2. What type of theoretical work? (optimization, learning theory, etc.)
3. Do you have any automated proof checking set up?
4. How do you typically validate theoretical results empirically?

**Researcher**: Everything's in ~/research/theory-project. I'm working on generalization bounds for neural networks. No automated proof checking yet. I usually implement toy examples in notebooks to verify my derivations make sense.

**Assistant**: Excellent! Let's enhance your theoretical research workflow:

**Step 1: Integration**
```bash
cd ~/research/theory-project
# Add the template while preserving your LaTeX structure
git remote add template https://github.com/[template-repo]
git fetch template
git merge template/main --allow-unrelated-histories --strategy-option=theirs
```

**Step 2: Theory-Specific Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p ai_docs/{derivations,proofs,notation,references}
mkdir -p specs/{theorems,lemmas,conjectures}
mkdir -p validation/{notebooks,scripts,figures}
```

**Step 3: Context for Theoretical Work**
Please create a comprehensive notation guide in `ai_docs/notation/notation_guide.md`:
```markdown
# Notation Guide

## Core Definitions
- 𝒲: Weight space of neural network
- ℛ(f): Rademacher complexity of function class
- ...

## Key Assumptions
- Lipschitz continuity: ||f(x) - f(y)|| ≤ L||x - y||
- ...
```

**Step 4: Proof Assistant Integration**
Let's create commands for theoretical work:
```bash
/verify-proof - Step-by-step proof verification
/check-derivation - Verify mathematical derivations
/empirical-validation - Generate code to test theoretical predictions
```

**Step 5: LaTeX + Notebook Workflow**
Set up AI-friendly documentation:
- Extract theorem statements to `ai_docs/theorems/`
- Create proof sketches in markdown
- Link notebooks to specific theoretical results

Would you like me to show you how to set up proof verification templates?
</examples>

<integration>
After setup is complete, suggest these next steps:

1. **Test Your First Custom Command**: Run the command we just created
2. **Iterate on CLAUDE.md**: Add more context as you discover what's needed
3. **Create More Commands**: Use `/crud-claude-commands` for each repetitive task
4. **Build Verification Loops**: Ensure AI can check its own work

Remember: The goal is to make your research workflow feel like you have a skilled research assistant who understands your domain deeply.
</integration>

<command_creation_guide>
## Creating Effective Research Commands

### Command Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each command should do one thing well
2. **Verification Built-in**: Always include ways to check success
3. **Context Aware**: Commands should understand your research domain
4. **Failure Tolerant**: Handle common errors gracefully
5. **Composable**: Commands should work well together

### Command Template Structure
When creating a new command with `/crud-claude-commands create [name]`, use this template:

```markdown
<role>
You are a [Domain] Research Assistant specializing in [Specific Task].
Your expertise includes:
- [Relevant skill 1]
- [Relevant skill 2]
- [Domain knowledge]
</role>

<task_context>
The researcher needs to [specific goal].
Common scenarios:
- [Scenario 1]
- [Scenario 2]
</task_context>

<verification>
Success criteria:
- [ ] Output matches expected format
- [ ] Results pass sanity checks
- [ ] No mock data in output
- [ ] Reproducible with same inputs
</verification>

<error_handling>
Common issues and solutions:
- Issue: [Common problem]
  Solution: [How to fix]
</error_handling>
```

### Making Commands Autonomous

Add this to your CLAUDE.md to enable automatic command usage:
```python
# In CLAUDE.md autonomous section
if "[trigger phrase]" in user_message:
    use_command("/[your-command]", args=extract_args())
```

Create a corresponding script in `scripts/`:
```python
# scripts/[your-command].py
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""Script version of /[your-command] for programmatic use"""

def main(args):
    # Implementation
    # Include verification
    # Return results
```

### Example: Creating an Experiment Runner

1. **Identify the Pattern**:
   - You always: setup config → run training → analyze results → save outputs

2. **Create the Command**:
   ```
   /crud-claude-commands create run-full-experiment
   ```

3. **Define the Workflow**:
   - Load experiment config
   - Verify environment setup
   - Run training with monitoring
   - Analyze results automatically
   - Generate report

4. **Add Verification**:
   - Check config validity
   - Monitor for NaN/overflow
   - Verify output formats
   - Compare with baselines

5. **Make it Autonomous**:
   - Trigger on "run experiment with [config]"
   - Auto-save checkpoints
   - Alert on anomalies
</command_creation_guide>

<best_practices>
1. **Start minimal**: Don't over-engineer the initial setup
2. **Iterate often**: Refine structure as you learn what works
3. **Document early**: Capture insights immediately
4. **Version control**: Commit after each setup step
5. **Test immediately**: Verify each component works before moving on
</best_practices>

<error_handling>
Common setup issues and solutions:

**"Command not found" errors**:
- Ensure .claude/commands/ is in the right location
- Check file permissions
- Restart Claude Code

**Git initialization fails**:
- Check if already in a git repo
- Ensure git is installed
- Try manual `git init`

**Package installation issues**:
- Use virtual environments
- Check Python version compatibility
- Try alternate package managers (uv, conda)

**Context too large**:
- Start with fewer papers/files
- Use summaries instead of full text
- Prioritize most relevant materials
</error_handling>

Remember: The goal is to create a research environment where AI agents can effectively assist with your specific workflow. Every research project is unique, so we'll customize the setup to match your needs exactly.

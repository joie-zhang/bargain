# Autonomous Command Usage Examples

These examples demonstrate how Claude Code will automatically detect and use the appropriate commands based on natural language requests.

## Example 1: Safety Review Request

### User Says:
"Can you review our reward model for potential misalignment?"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects trigger**: "review" + "reward model" + "misalignment"
2. **Uses**: `/multi-mind "Review reward model for alignment and safety issues"`
3. **Deploys specialists**:
   - Alignment Researcher (goal misspecification)
   - Safety Analyst (failure modes)
   - Robustness Expert (distribution shifts)
   - Interpretability Specialist (hidden behaviors)
4. **Synthesizes findings** into safety assessment report

## Example 2: Training Performance Investigation

### User Says:
"The transformer training is really slow, can you help?"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects trigger**: "slow" + "training" (performance issue)
2. **Chain of commands**:
   ```
   /search-all "transformer training performance optimization"
   → Finds 3 similar past issues
   
   /analyze-function forward_pass
   → Discovers inefficient attention computation
   
   /multi-mind "Optimization strategies for transformer training"
   → Gets expert recommendations
   ```
3. **Provides**: Root cause + past solutions + optimization plan

## Example 3: Research Tool Development

### User Says:
"I need to add an interpretability analysis tool to our framework"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects trigger**: "add" + "tool" (new research tool)
2. **Workflow**:
   ```
   /spec-driven "Interpretability tool with attention visualization and feature attribution"
   → Generates comprehensive spec with test cases
   
   /plan-with-context "Implement interpretability tool from spec"
   → Creates phased implementation plan
   
   /page "interpretability-tool-phase1"
   → Saves progress at milestone
   ```

## Example 4: Context Management

### User Working on Complex Task:
[Context at 75%]

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Monitors context**: Detects 75% usage
2. **Suggests**: "We're at 75% context. Should I save progress with /page?"
3. **If continued to 80%**:
   - Auto-executes: `/page "complex-task-checkpoint"`
   - Provides: "Saved session. Run `claude --resume complex-task-checkpoint` to continue"

## Example 5: Repeated Patterns

### User Says (3rd time):
"Run the standard safety evaluation suite on the new model checkpoint"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects repetition**: Same request pattern 3 times
2. **Suggests**: "I notice you're repeating this pattern. Should I create a custom command?"
3. **Creates**: `/crud-claude-commands create safety-eval-runner "Run standardized safety evaluation suite on model checkpoints"`

## Example 6: Past Solution Search

### User Says:
"We had a similar gradient explosion issue last month, what did we do?"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects trigger**: "similar" + "last month" + "what did we do"
2. **Uses**: `/search-all "gradient explosion issue"`
3. **Finds**: 
   - Session from 2024-11-15 with gradient clipping solution
   - Specific fix: Added adaptive gradient clipping
   - Training improvement: Stable convergence achieved
4. **Suggests**: "Found it! Here's what we did..." [shows solution]

## Example 7: Architecture Decision

### User Says:
"Should we use RLHF or constitutional AI for our alignment approach?"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects trigger**: "should we" (decision needed)
2. **Uses**: `/multi-mind "RLHF vs constitutional AI alignment decision"`
3. **Deploys specialists**:
   - Alignment Researcher (theoretical foundations)
   - ML Engineer (implementation complexity)
   - Safety Expert (failure mode analysis)  
   - Scaling Specialist (compute requirements)
   - Evaluation Expert (measurement strategies)
4. **Provides**: Balanced analysis with recommendation

## Example 8: Code Understanding

### User Says:
"I don't understand what the compute_attention_scores function does"

### Claude Code Automatically:
1. **Detects trigger**: "understand" + function name
2. **Uses**: `/analyze-function compute_attention_scores`
3. **Provides**:
   - Line-by-line explanation
   - Complexity analysis (O(n² × d))
   - Memory bottlenecks identified
   - Flash attention optimization suggested
   - Numerical stability considerations

## Transparency Patterns

In each case, Claude Code will:
- **Announce**: "I'll use /multi-mind to get expert perspectives on this"
- **Show progress**: "Deploying 5 specialists for analysis..."
- **Present results**: Clear, structured findings
- **Suggest next steps**: Based on the analysis

## Command Chaining Intelligence

Claude Code understands these patterns:
- Safety concern → `/multi-mind` → `/spec-driven` (design mitigations)
- Training issue → `/search-all` → `/analyze-function` → `/multi-mind`
- New research tool → `/spec-driven` → `/plan-with-context` → `/page`
- Complex analysis → `/multi-mind` → `/page` (save findings)

## Confidence Levels

Claude Code will:
- **High confidence** (90%+): Auto-execute command
- **Medium confidence** (70-90%): Suggest command with explanation
- **Low confidence** (<70%): Ask for clarification

Example:
```
User: "Check the model"
Claude: "I can help with that! Could you clarify what aspect you'd like me to check?
- Safety and alignment? (I'd use /multi-mind)
- Training performance? (I'd use /analyze-function)
- Evaluation metrics? (I'd search for established benchmarks)"
```
